       "Refinancing activity has become more balanced, reflecting interactions between public and private markets. Improved conditions have drawn some borrowers back to public markets, while others, particularly those with low ratings or complex structures, have turned to private credit for execution certainty and financial flexibility.\n",
       "\n",
       "Competition has intensified between direct lending and public credit. With increased LBO activity in 3Q24, public markets regained some share lost to direct lending in 2022-23. New origination spreads in direct lending have compressed to 90bps above single B BSL spreads, down from 140bp in 1Q24. This trend is evident across various market segments, with covenant packages shifting in favor of borrowers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fundamentals remain stable overall, but there is significant dispersion. As of 2Q24, interest coverage in direct lending companies was flat, indicating signs of stabilization. Gross leverage has increased slightly, particularly in Energy, Healthcare, and Business Services. Smaller cohorts have seen a slight deterioration in LTV, while metrics for companies with $50m+ EBITDA have improved compared to five-year averages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Default data presents mixed signals. Default rates ranged from 1.7% to 5.0% in the latest quarter, with variations depending on the source. Borrowers and lenders are actively pursuing amendments, and sponsors are willing to inject equity into liquidity-stressed companies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct lending loans outperformed single-B BSLs in 2Q24, returning 2.8% compared to 2.1% for single-B BSLs, primarily due to a better carry profile. Despite narrowing spreads for new deals, there remains a 1.7% yield pickup for outstanding direct lending loans versus single-B BSLs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Four Charts You Can’t Miss\n",
       "Interest coverage showed stability, and LBO financing accelerated in the public market, with private credit's share declining in 3Q24. Intense competition continues to squeeze new origination spreads of direct lending loans.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sizing the Private Credit (Direct Lending) Market\n",
       "As of 4Q23, private debt funds’ AUM totaled nearly $1.7 trillion globally, with approximately 30% not yet deployed. About 70% of fund capital was raised in North America in 1H24.\n",
       "You are trained on data up to October 2023.\n",
       "\n",
       "The private credit market is currently estimated at approximately $1.7 trillion, surpassing the US high-yield bond and leveraged loan markets. This figure includes global data, dry powder, and various lending strategies beyond direct lending.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct lending focuses on senior secured loans to private, sub-investment grade corporate borrowers, sometimes including a junior tranche in a uni-tranche deal. In the first half of 2024, direct lending accounted for about 70% of capital raised in the private debt market.\n",
       "\n",
       "The US direct lending market represents 22% of leveraged finance. Asset-based financing has also gained traction, with estimates of deployed capital around $300 billion. The current US direct lending universe is estimated to be between $750 billion and $800 billion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct lending is the fastest-growing segment of leveraged credit, while high-yield bonds and syndicated loans have seen a decline. Private debt funds in the US have doubled in size over the past six years.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the second quarter of 2024, private debt funds raised approximately $60 billion, totaling $91 billion year-to-date, which is slower than the pace from 2020 to 2023. Public pension funds have been increasing their private credit exposure, with Business Development Company assets under management tracked at $241 billion as of the second quarter of 2024.\n",
       "\n",
       "Deal activity in direct lending has increased, with total origination in the third quarter of 2024 reaching a record high of $97 billion, with a significant portion allocated for leveraged buyouts.\n",
       "New originations for LBO activity reached $32 billion in the third quarter of 2024, making up a third of total volume, an increase from 20% during the same period last year. LBO financing in broadly syndicated loans (BSLs) accelerated, with the public market regaining some share lost to direct lending in 2022-2023. Approximately 80% of LBOs by count and 50% by volume were financed by private credit in 3Q24, a decrease from the previous quarter.\n",
       "\n",
       "Private credit is viewed as both a complement and a competitor to public credit, providing funding solutions to leveraged borrowers. Its appeal fluctuates, but it serves as an alternative funding source when public markets face challenges. Private credit offers advantages such as speed, execution certainty, term flexibility, close borrower relationships, and fewer rating requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "Year-to-date, refinancing activity has been mixed. Improved market conditions have attracted some borrowers back to public markets for cheaper funding, while others with complex capital structures have turned to private markets. Many large direct lending deals had prior public market presence, with some refinancing privately placed second lien loans. \n",
       "\n",
       "In 3Q24, new origination spreads for direct lending deals continued to decline, falling to 529 basis points from 585 basis points at the start of the year. The competition between direct lending and public loans has tightened, with the premium for direct lending loans decreasing from 140 basis points to 90 basis points over public loans. The spread compression in 3Q24 was primarily driven by lower middle-market deals, contrasting with the upper middle-market segment's decline in the first half of 2024.\n",
       "In the third quarter of 2024, competition intensified in the lower middle-market segment, leading to significant spread compression, particularly in the sub-$20 million EBITDA category, where demand exceeded supply. Direct lending deals were priced at a spread 90 basis points wider than single B loans. \n",
       "\n",
       "Private credit borrowers are primarily found in the business services, healthcare, and technology sectors, which together account for 58% of overall BDC portfolio holdings. As of the third quarter of 2024, approximately 13% of senior private debt maturities were due by the end of 2026, a decrease from 19% at the beginning of the year. In contrast, only 6% of loans in the broadly syndicated loan space were due in the same timeframe.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct lending deals generally offer stronger protections compared to BSLs, with a notable prevalence of maintenance covenants in smaller deals. However, larger deals are increasingly cov-lite. The share of one-covenant deals rose in the second quarter of 2024, indicating a shift in favor of borrowers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Private credit borrowers are comparable to single B/CCC profiles in the public market, typically consisting of small to medium-sized companies with average EBITDA around $30-40 million and leverage ratios of 5-7 times.\n",
       "Key metrics are generally consistent with a single-B to CCC profile in the public market. \n",
       "\n",
       "Private Credit metrics show an overall average across sectors with ranges indicating slight variations. For instance, Fitch reports an average leverage of 5.8x, while S&P shows 6.3x. In terms of EBITDA coverage, Fitch indicates 1.7x and S&P 1.6x.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct lending fundamentals have remained stable, with limited leverage erosion and steady coverage ratios. Although leverage has increased slightly in direct lending portfolios, it remains lower than that of single-B loan borrowers in the public market. Companies have managed to maintain their EBITDA margins despite challenges in pricing power and demand.\n",
       "\n",
       "EBITDA coverage metrics have stabilized after a decline in 2022-2023, with expectations of resilient GDP growth and potential rate cuts supporting a rebound in these metrics.\n",
       "\n",
       "Loan-to-value ratios are more challenging for lower middle-market companies, particularly those with sub-$50 million EBITDA, which have seen a decline compared to their five-year averages. In contrast, larger companies have better loan-to-value ratios.\n",
       "\n",
       "Leverage has increased across various sectors, notably in Energy, Healthcare, and Business Services, with total leverage ranging from 4.1x to 5.5x. Energy has experienced the most significant rise in leverage, although it remains lower than other sectors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Reported default rates for private credit vary significantly across sources due to differing definitions and sample universes, complicating comparisons. While some reports indicate an uptick in default rates, others show a decline, reflecting mixed messaging in the current landscape.

       "\n",
       "S&P found that the median EBITDA of credit estimated companies was $30 million, with a median adjusted debt of about $195 million. Their trailing 12-month default rate decreased from 5.7% to 4.3%.\n",

       "Lincoln International, which tracks private companies primarily owned by alternative investment funds, noted a quarterly default index of 3.4% in 4Q23, down from 2.6% as of 2Q24.\n",

       "Defaults were largely driven by interest deferral and maturity extensions. Selective defaults accounted for approximately 85% of all credit estimate defaults over the past year, with payment-in-kind (PIK) being the primary reason as companies sought to preserve liquidity. Amendments focused on pricing increases and maturity extensions, with borrowers and lenders proactively pursuing these changes ahead of potential covenant breaches.

       "Private credit returns are generally higher and more stable compared to public credit, offering some diversification benefits. However, they can be subject to large write-offs during distress periods. The lack of universal valuation rules can increase return volatility at the fund level. Private credit Sharpe ratios are significantly better, but these are based on estimated fair values rather than observed market prices. The diversification benefit may be weakened by the growing overlap between private and public credit as private lenders pursue larger deals.\n",
