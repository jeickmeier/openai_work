And much of what we think we know about discount rates comes from studying \\na particular  kind of expected payoff: the earnings forecasts in analyst reports. Researchers typically \\naccess these numbers through an easy-to-use database and never read the underlying documents. \\nThis is unfortunate  because the text of each report contains an explicit description of how the \\nanalyst priced their own earnings forecast. We study a sample of 513 reports and find that most \\nanalysts use a trailing P/E (price-to-earnings)  ratio not a discount rate. Instead of computing the \\npresent value of a company’s future earnings, they ask: “How would a firm with similar earnings \\nhave been priced last year?” Even if other investors do things differently, it does not make sense to \\nput discount rates at the center of every asset-pricing  model if market participants do not always use \\none. There are other options. Trailing twelve-month  P/E ratios account for 91% of the variation in \\nanalysts’ price targets.We construct a new kind of asset-pricing  model around this fact and show \\nthat it explains the market response to earnings surprises.\\nItzhak Ben-David\\nThe Ohio State University\\nFisher College of Business\\n606A Fisher Hall\\nColumbus, OH 43210-1144\\nand NBER\\nben-david.1@osu.edu\\nAlex Chinco\\nZicklin School of Business\\nBaruch College, CUNY\\nOne Bernard Baruch Way\\nNew York, NY 10010\\nAlexChinco@gmail.com\\nIntroduction\\nAt the moment, “asset-pricing theory all stems from one simple concept:\\nprice equals expected discounted payoff. The rest is elaboration, special cases,\\nand a closet full of tricks. (Cochrane, 2009, page 1)” Researchers are willing\\nto entertain the idea that investors might have biased subjective beliefs or\\nhold non-standard preferences. But no one ever questions whether real-world\\ninvestors apply present-value logic.\\nSuppose you buy a share of stock today and then sell it next year after\\ncollecting the dividend. Your total future payoff will be Dividend 𝑡+1+Price𝑡+1.\\nAll standard models assume the current price will be given by something like\\nPrice𝑡=E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]+E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]\\n1+𝑟(1)\\nwhere E𝑡[·]reflects investors’ subjective beliefs about an asset’s payoff next\\nyear and𝑟is the discount rate they apply to these payoffs.\\nFigure 1 shows a December 2019 report about Home Depot written by Chris\\nHorvers, a senior analyst at JP Morgan. Chris Horvers starts his report by telling\\ninvestors to “Overweight” Home Depot in their portfolios—i.e., buy more shares.\\nThen, he sets a price target of E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=$241 for Home Depot in December\\n2020 (one year into the future) based on his view that the company would have\\nearnings per share (EPS) of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]=$10.48over the next twelve months\\n(FY2020) and E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]=$11.50the year after (FY2021).\\nThese are the sorts of numbers that researchers are used to downloading\\nfrom the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (IBES). Given that all asset-\\npricing models start with “price equals expected discounted payoff”, researchers\\nwould love to have similar data on all investors’ payoff expectations as well.\\nUnfortunately, most market participants do not publicly announce their subjec-\\ntive beliefs. Sell-side analysts do, and as a result their forecasts have had a big\\nimpact on the asset-pricing literature (Kothari, So, and Verdi, 2016).\\nResearchers are primarily interested in discount rates, and much of what\\nwe think we know about them comes from studying IBES data. Researchers\\n1\\n(a) Top of first page\\n (b) Key Metrics\\nFigure 1. Earning report about Home Depot, which was published on December\\n12th 2019 by JP Morgan. The lead analyst on this report was Chris Horvers.\\nhave spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how analysts discount their\\nown subjective earnings forecasts. It is common to see researchers estimate an\\nimplied discount rate by replacing the numerator in Equation (1)with analysts’\\nvalues of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]+E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]and solving for 𝑟. Researchers frequently\\nanalyze longer-term effects by plugging analysts’ forecasts into Campbell and\\nShiller (1988)’s log-linear approximation to Equation (1).\\nBut researchers do not need to figure out how sell-side analysts price their\\nown earnings forecasts. They describe their approach in the text of each report.\\nWe read what analysts write and find that most do not use a discount rate.\\nThey multiply their short-term earnings forecast times a trailing P/E (price-\\nto-earnings) ratio. Rather than asking “How much is this company’s expected\\nearnings worth in today’s dollars?”, they ask “If a firm had reported similar\\nearnings last year , how would it have been priced given recent multiples?”\\nResearchers cannot take it for granted that an asset’s price always reflects\\nits expected discounted payoff. Sometimes financial markets work this way. But\\nin many important cases they do not. At the end of the day, it does not make\\nsense to organize our entire field around the concept of discount rates if we\\ncannot count on investors actually using one. The rest of the paper is about\\nwhere we go from here. We model an alternative path forward that reflects\\nhow analysts describe their own pricing rule and show that this model can\\nexplain important patterns in real-world data.\\n2\\nFigure 2. How Chris Horvers described calculating his $241 price target for Home\\nDepot in his December 2019 earnings report for JP Morgan.\\nSection 1 examines a sample of 513 sell-side analyst reports, which were\\nwritten about large publicly traded companies from 2003 through 2022. These\\nreports show that most analysts do not take a present-value approach to pricing\\ntheir own subjective earnings expectations. Instead, they typically set a com-\\npany’s price target, PriceTarget𝑡def=E𝑡[Price𝑡+1], equal to the firm’s expected\\nshort-term earnings times its trailing P/E.\\nSell-side research is more than just dry colorless lists of numbers. Analysts\\nhave been required to state their pricing rule in the text of each report since\\nMay 2002 when the SEC passed NASD Rule 2711. The current statute is FINRA\\nRule 2241, which says “any recommendation, rating, or price target [must be]\\naccompanied by a clear explanation of any valuation method used.”\\nFigure 2 shows the “clear explanation” that Chris Horvers gave in his report.\\nHe could have said that he carefully examined Home Depot’s expected cash-flow\\nstream from 2021 onward. He could have gone deep into the weeds, outlining\\nprecisely how he discounted these expected future cash flows back to December\\n2020. He was more than capable of doing this sort of analysis.\\n3\\nChris Horvers chose not to. He plainly states that his $241 price target for\\nHome Depot was “based on ∼21.0×our revised 2021E EPS, in line with its\\nthree-year average”\\nE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]\\n$241=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]\\n$11.50×\\x12\\n1\\n3·2∑︁\\nℓ=0TrailingPE𝑡−ℓ\\x13\\n21.0(2)\\nTo forecast Home Depot’s share price in December 2020 (end of period 𝑡+1), he\\nmultiplied his EPS forecast for 2021 (period 𝑡+2) times a 3-year trailing average\\nP/E based on 2017, 2018, and 2019 (periods 𝑡−2,𝑡−1, and𝑡).\\nIt is possible to interpret certain kinds of multiples analysis as special cases\\nof present-value logic. For example, the classic Gordon model comes from\\niterating Equation (1) forward and assuming constant dividend growth\\nfor𝑖=(𝑡+1)to∞:\\nreplace Price𝑖\\nwithE𝑖[Dividend 𝑖+1]+E𝑖[Price𝑖+1]\\n1+𝑟\\nAssume:(1+𝑔)ℎ=E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+ℎ]\\nDividend 𝑡Price𝑡=E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]+E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]\\n1+𝑟(1)\\n=∞∑︁\\nℎ=1E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+ℎ]\\n(1+𝑟)ℎ(3)\\n=E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]×\\x101\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x11\\n(4)\\nThe resulting pricing rule in Equation (4)uses a forward-looking multiple,\\x001\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x01=\\x10Í∞\\nℎ=1E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+ℎ]\\n(1+𝑟)ℎ\\x11.\\nE𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1], as a shortcut for calculating the\\npresent value of an infinite stream of expected future dividend payments.\\nWhile the timing of Equation (2)strongly suggests Chris Horvers has seen\\nthe Gordon model, his underlying economic logic could not be more different.\\nThere is nothing forward-looking about the “Valuation Matrix” in Figure 2.\\nChris Horvers’ arrived at his $241 price target by asking himself: “How has\\nthe market typically priced each $1of Home Depot’s earnings during the past\\nfew years?” Moreover , he did this in spite of the fact that he gave Home Depot\\nan “overweight” rating. Chris Horvers felt the market had been undervaluing\\nHome Depot and expected the company to experience multiples expansion\\ngoing forward. He still used a trailing P/E to set his price target.\\n4\\nOur point is not that Chris Horvers is a bad analyst. Chris Horvers is an\\nexcellent analyst. He has been named to Institutional Investor magazine’s All-\\nAmerican team multiple times, and his December 2019 report about Home\\nDepot is the kind of report that other analysts are striving to produce. We greatly\\nadmire Chris Horvers’ work. We think other researchers should actually read it.\\nThere is so much more to sell-side research than the handful of numerical\\nvalues found in IBES. Every report includes a detailed explanation showing\\nhow the analyst valued the company. Chris Horvers tells us that he is not setting\\nprice equal to expected discounted payoff, and most other sell-side analysts say\\nthe same thing. As a rule, they do not apply present-value logic when pricing\\ntheir own subjective cash-flow expectations.\\nFrankly, it is surprising that so many papers have been written about biased\\nearnings forecasts. Analysts put a lot of effort into getting those numbers right.\\nChris Horvers spent pages justifying his value of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]=$11.50. Then,\\nwhen it came time to capitalize this expected cash flow into a share price, he\\ndid not even attempt to approximateÍ∞\\nℎ=1E𝑡[EPS𝑡+ℎ]\\n(1+𝑟)ℎ. He chose not to apply the\\n“one simple concept” that is the bedrock of our entire research program.\\nResearchers are free to continue pretending that price always equals ex-\\npected discounted payoff if they want to. You can still use IBES data to estimate\\ndiscount rates and perform Campbell and Shiller (1988) decompositions like\\nnothing has changed. But what would be the point? If the imputed values have\\nnothing to do with how assets are actually being priced, then they will not be\\nrelevant in the future or helpful for evaluating policy counterfactuals.\\nSection 2 outlines a productive path forward. In many applications, “price\\nequals expected discounted payoff” is not a good foundation to build a model\\non. If you are interested in modeling how S&P 500 companies get priced and\\nplan on using IBES data in your empirical work, then you need a theory that\\nstems from some other “simple concept”. We show what such a model might\\nlook like. Our theory provides a simple rationale for why analysts use trailing\\nP/E ratios and also generates sharp testable predictions.\\nHere is how the model works. There is a single stock, and each year analysts\\nset a one-year-ahead price target. If this price target is higher or lower than\\n5\\nthe firm’s current share price, then investors proportionally adjust their hold-\\nings at rate 𝜇 > 0. When the price target is 1%higher than a stock’s current\\nprice, investors increase their holdings by 𝜇%over the next year. The stock’s\\nsubsequent price growth also proportionally responds to changes in investors’\\ndemand. Each 1%change in investor demand causes the company’s expected\\nreturn to change by 𝜈%over the next year for some 𝜈>0.\\nOur model suggests a plausible justification for using trailing P/E ratios.\\nThe equilibrium price in our model is mostly backward-looking. There is only\\none forward-looking input: analysts’ short-term EPS forecast. It makes sense\\nfor analysts to use a mostly backward-looking pricing rule in a world where\\nprices themselves are mostly backward-looking. In such a world, PriceTarget =\\nE[EPS]×TrailingPE can generate forecasts that are correct on average.\\nIt also makes sharp testable predictions. Imagine that immediately after\\nChris Horvers published his December 2019 report, he saw something that led\\nhim to believe Home Depot’s earnings would go up by ΔE[EPS]=+$0.05over\\nthe next year and then grow at a Δ𝑔=+1%faster rate thereafter . In our model,\\nthe change in Home Depot’s long-run growth rate would be irrelevant. The\\ncompany had been trading at 21.0×, so Chris Horvers’ price target would go up\\nbyΔPriceTarget =$1.05=21.0×$0.05. By contrast, in the Gordon model, the\\n+1%increase in Home Depot’s long-run growth rate would cause Chris Horvers\\nto use a larger multiple, leading to an even larger increase in his price target.\\nSection 3 demonstrates that trailing P/E ratios explain both analysts’ price\\ntargets and realized price changes. We start with analysts’ price targets. Chris\\nHorvers said he used a trailing P/E ratio to set price targets for Home Depot.\\nFigure 3 shows that IBES data support this claim.\\nThe red line in the top panel shows Chris Horvers’ most recent PriceTarget𝑡def=\\nE𝑡[Price𝜏+1]on each trading day 𝑡during the window from 18months to\\n6months prior to Home Depot’s next fiscal year-end date, (𝜏+1). The red\\nline in the bottom panel shows the P/E ratio implied by Chris Horvers’ price\\ntarget and his earnings forecast for the following fiscal year, ImpliedPE𝑡def=\\nPriceTarget𝑡/E𝑡[EPS𝜏+2]. This implied P/E closely tracks Home Depot’s trailing\\ntwelve-month (TTM) P/E ratio shown in blue, TrailingPE𝑡def=Price𝑡/EPS𝑡.\\n6\\n$241\\n$11.50\\n21.0×Price\\nCurr 𝑊TgtEPS\\nTTM 𝑊NTMP/E\\nTTM 𝑊Impl\\nAug‘12 Jan‘14Jan‘15Jan‘16Jan‘17Jan‘18Jan‘19Jan‘20Jan‘21Jan‘22$52$151$416\\n$2.61$7.23$18.45\\n14.8×21.4×28.7×Christopher Horvers’ forecasts for Home Depot (HD)Figure 3.𝑦-axis labels correspond to the min, median, and max in each panel.

Nevertheless, the\\nright panel of Figure 4 shows that our simple trailing twelve-month calculation\\nis a good first approximation to how most analysts set price targets.\\nBy capturing the essence of what analysts say they are doing, PriceTarget =\\nE[EPS]×TrailingPE , we are able to explain over 91% of the variation in their\\nprice targets. Our model’s fit is not perfect. But it predicts investors’ subjective\\nreturn expectations far better than any other model we know of.\\nWe next turn our attention to how the market responds to earnings surprises.\\nWhen a company announces quarterly earnings that deviate from the consensus\\nforecast, investors often learn important things about a firm that can have long-\\nterm ramifications. The larger the surprise, the more likely this is. In the Gordon\\nmodel, a change in the long-run earnings growth rate would cause investors to\\nprice a firm’s expected short-run earnings using a different multiple.\\n7\\n45°lineChristopher Horvers\\nHome Depot (HD)All IBES Analysts\\nAll Stocks\\n10×20×30×40× 10×20×30×40×10×20×30×40×ImpliedPE TrailingPE →Figure 4.

(Right) Binned scatterplot of\\ndays on which any IBES analyst updated their price target for any firm.\\nBy contrast, our model uses a trailing P/E that is set in stone. Analysts update\\ntheir price targets to reflect changes in their short-term earnings forecast. The\\ncompany’s share price responds proportionally, ΔPrice ={𝜆·(EPS−E[EPS])}×\\nTrailingPE for some𝜆 >0. Importantly, our model says that the same value of\\n𝜆will apply no matter how large or small the earnings surprise was.\\nWe test this prediction using an approach similar to Fama and MacBeth\\n(1973). First, we group stock-quarter observations by the size of their earnings\\nsurprise,𝑠∈{− $0.30,..., $0.30}. Then, within each bucket, we run a separate\\nregression to estimate the relationship between a stock’s trailing P/E ratio and\\nits subsequent price change, ˆ𝜆𝑠. This gives us 60distinct estimates for 𝜆·𝑠, and\\nwe verify that they all imply a very similar value of ˆ𝜆𝑠/𝑠=𝜆.\\nThere is a deep crack in the foundation of asset-pricing theory. Researchers\\ncurrently assume that an asset’s price must always reflect some sort of expected\\ndiscounted payoff. They spend most of their time trying to understand how an\\nasset’s expected payoff is being discounted, and analysts’ earnings forecasts\\nhave played a key role in this pursuit. However, when we read what analysts\\nwrite in their reports, we find that most of them do not set price targets by\\ndiscounting a company’s expected EPS. Instead, they typically use a trailing P/E\\nratio. We point to a better way forward by constructing a new kind of model\\nand showing that it explains key patterns in the data.\\n8\\nRelated literature. This paper borrows from and builds on several strands\\nof related literature. To start with, it is an asset-pricing analog to Ben-David\\nand Chinco (2024). In that paper, we took managers at their word when they\\nsaid they were EPS maximizers and fleshed out the implications for corporate\\npolicies. In this paper, we take sell-side analysts at their word when they say\\nthey use trailing P/E ratios and derive the implications for asset prices.\\nWe are not the first researchers to notice that market participants talk\\nabout short-term cash-flow multiples. There are numerous papers studying\\nthe accuracy of multiples analysis for pricing public equities (Bhojraj and Lee,\\n2002; Liu et al., 2002; Da and Schaumburg, 2011; Bartram and Grinblatt, 2018;\\nCooper and Lambertides, 2023), IPOs (Kim and Ritter, 1999; Purnanandam and\\nSwaminathan, 2004), and syndicated loan deals (Murfin and Pratt, 2019). We\\nthink these papers are fascinating and deserve far more attention. But we also\\nthink they bury the lede. The fact that analysts use a trailing P/E is inconsistent\\nwith textbook present-value logic. . . no matter how accurate their forecasts are.\\nOur paper connects to the broader literature on belief formation (Mal-\\nmendier and Nagel, 2011; Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014; Coibion and Gorod-\\nnichenko, 2015; Giglio, Maggiori, Stroebel, and Utkus, 2021; Bordalo, Gennaioli,\\nMa, and Shleifer, 2020). There is substantial evidence that sell-side analysts\\nsuffer from predictable biases when making earnings forecasts (La Porta, 1996;\\nSo, 2013; Bouchaud, Krueger , Landier , and Thesmar, 2019; Bordalo, Gennaioli,\\nLa Porta, and Shleifer, 2019, 2020, 2024; De la O and Myers, 2021). We would\\nalso like to know how biases in analysts’ subjective earnings forecasts affect\\nasset prices. But, to answer this question, researchers need to correctly model\\nhow these subjective beliefs get priced.\\nLast but not least, this paper provides evidence against the discount-rate\\napproach to asset pricing. Textbook models say that “asset markets are [supposed\\nto be] in reality big insurance markets (Cochrane, 1999).” These models argue\\nthat a company’s current share price should reflect investors’ desire to insure\\nthemselves against exposure to specific kinds of future aggregate risks. It is\\nhard to find people who think this way in the real world (Chinco, Hartzmark,\\nand Sussman, 2022). This paper proposes a simple alternative approach.\\n9\\n1 In Their Own Words\\nThe goal of asset-pricing research is to figure out how market participants\\nwould price any arbitrary set of risky cash flows. However, in the particular\\ncase of sell-side analysts, there is nothing to figure out. For the past two decades,\\nanalysts have been legally required to write down their pricing rule in the text\\nof each earnings report. In May 2002, the SEC passed NASD Rule 2711 stating\\nthat: “If a research report contains a price target, the [analyst] must disclose in\\nthe research report the valuation methods used to determine the price target.”\\nIn this section, we examine how analysts explain their own pricing rule and\\nfind that most do not compute any sort of expected discounted payoff. Instead,\\nthey typically rely on a trailing P/E ratio.\\n1.1 Data description\\nAnalysts explicitly state how they price their own subjective cash-flow\\nexpectations in the text of each earnings report. We read these reports and\\nask: “How did the author of this report convert their earnings forecast, E𝑡[EPS],\\ninto a price target, PriceTarget𝑡?” Every report has an entire section where the\\nanalyst directly answers this question as shown in Figure 2.\\nWe downloaded 513earnings reports from Investext in two separate waves.\\nWe started with 339reports written about the 30largest publicly traded compa-\\nnies at year-end in 2004, 2011, and 2019. This gives us 47companies in total\\n(see Table 1). For each company in a given year , we include one report written\\nby each brokerage in Table 2.\\nBased on this first sample, it does not look like sell-side analysts apply present-\\nvalue reasoning to price their own subjective cash-flow expectations. However ,\\nthese are run-of-the-mill reports written by average analysts. Perhaps the best\\nanalysts still use forward-looking present-value logic when writing reports that\\nreally matter?\\nTo check whether this is the case, we then downloaded an additional 174\\ncoverage-initiation reports written by 28sell-side analysts who have been\\n10\\nNumber of reports about each company (Sample #1)\\n2004 2011 2019 Total\\n1 Abbott Labs 3 4 4 11\\n2 Adobe 6 6\\n3 AIG 3 3\\n4 Altria 3 3\\n5 Amazon 3 7 10\\n6 American Express 3 3\\n7 Amgen 4 4\\n8 Apple 5 7 12\\n9 AT&T 3 2 5\\n10 Bank of America 3 6 9\\n11 Boeing 5 5\\n12 Chevron 3 3 7 13\\n13 Cisco 3 4 6 13\\n14 Citigroup 2 4 5 11\\n15 Coca-Cola 3 2 4 9\\n16 ConocoPhillips 1 1\\n17 Dell 4 4\\n18 Disney 3 3\\n19 eBay 4 4\\n20 Exxon Mobil 3 2 7 12\\n21 Facebook 6 6\\n22 GE 3 3 6\\n23 Google 4 7 11\\n24 Home Depot 4 6 10\\n25 IBM 4 4 8\\n26 Intel 3 3 5 11\\n27 Johnson & Johnson 3 3 1 7\\n28 JP Morgan 2 2 4 8\\n29 Mastercard 7 7\\n30 McDonalds 4 4\\n31 Merck 2 3 3 8\\n32 Microsoft 4 4 6 14\\n33 Occidental 3 3\\n34 Oracle 3 4 6 13\\n35 Pepsi 3 1 5 9\\n36 Pfizer 3 4 5 12\\n37 Philip Morris 2 2\\n38 Procter & Gamble 3 3 6\\n39 Qualcomm 4 4\\n40 Schlumberger 2 2\\n41 Time Warner 3 3\\n42 UBS 1 1\\n43 UnitedHealth 6 6\\n44 Verizon 3 3 5 11\\n45 Visa 7 7\\n46 Walmart 3 3 6 12\\n47 Wells Fargo 3 3 1 7\\nTotal 91 93 155 339\\nTable 1.

Table 4 shows that analysts used some form\\nof multiples analysis in 94.5%of our sample ( 485out of 513reports). Price-to-\\nearnings (P/E) was the most common multiple and was listed in the methods\\nsection 76.8%of the time.\\nAnalysts set a price target based on a multiple of earnings before interest,\\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), cash flows (CF), or sales 43.9%\\nof the time ( 225 of513 reports). These calculations are delevered versions of\\nE[EPS]×TrailingPE . Analysts often use E[EBITDA]×TrailingEVtoEBITDA in\\nsituations where a company’s EPS has been negative in recent years. In this\\npaper , we treat it as a separate method to be as conservative as possible.\\n15\\nMost analysts used multiples analysis to set price targets\\n2004 2011 2019 All Am Total\\nAny Multiple 85.7% 91 .4% 96 .8% 98 .9% 94 .5%\\n78 85 150 172 485\\nP/E ratio 79.1% 83 .9% 80 .0% 69 .0% 76 .8%\\n72 78 124 120 394\\nEBITDA, CF, Sales 27.1% 31 .9% 50 .6% 50 .6% 43 .9%\\n25 30 82 88 225\\nBook Value 7.7% 16 .1% 7 .7% 3 .4% 7 .8%\\n7 15 12 6 40\\nP/E-to-Growth 8.8% 9 .7% 40 .7% 11 .6% 10 .3%\\n8 9 18 18 53\\nDividend Yield 8.8% 2 .2% 5 .2% 8 .6% 6 .4%\\n8 2 8 15 33\\n# Reports 91 93 155 174 513\\nTable 4. “Any Multiple”: report used at least one multiple to calculate the price\\ntarget. “P/E Ratio”: report used a firm’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (P/E). “EBITDA,\\nCF, Sales”: report set a price target based on a multiple of EBITDA, cash flow, or\\nsales. “Book Value”: report used a multiple of the book value of a firm’s assets.\\n“P/E-to-Growth”: report used the ratio of a company’s P/E to its EPS growth rate.\\n“Dividend Yield”: report used a firm’s dividend yield when setting a price target. Top\\nnumber in each cell is the percent relative to the total for the column. e.g., 78of91\\nreports in 2004 described using some form of multiples analysis, 78/91=85.7%.\\nAgain, there is nothing inherently wrong with multiples analysis. The issue\\nis the way that analysts calculate their multiple. Sell-side analysts typically\\nchoose their multiple based on where the firm and others like it have been\\ntrading at in recent years. Table 5 shows that analysts set a price target by\\nlooking at a firm’s own trailing multiple in 63.5%of our sample ( 326 of513\\nreports). They looked at the recent pricing of the firm’s peer group in 74.1%of\\nour sample ( 380 reports), and they made both kinds of comparisons in over\\nhalf of the reports in our sample ( 260out of 513reports; 50.7%).\\nThe popularity of peer-group comparisons in our data is driven by the fact\\nthat coverage-initiation reports make up a third of our sample ( 174 of513\\nreports; 33.9%). As noted earlier , many of these firms recently went public. In\\nthese cases, there is often not enough trailing data to compute an average.\\n16\\nAnalysts pick multiples based on past realizations\\n2004 2011 2019 All Am Total\\nOwn Past Pricing 50.5% 50.5% 54.8% 85.1% 63.5%\\n46 47 85 148 326\\nPricing of Peers 69.2% 60.2% 59.4% 97.1% 74.1%\\n63 56 92 169 380\\nBoth Comparisons 38.5% 31.2% 31.6% 84.5% 50.7%\\n35 29 49 147 260\\n# Reports 91 93 155 174 513\\nTable 5. “Own past pricing”: analyst computed a multiple that reflects a firm’s\\nown past pricing in recent years. “Pricing of peers”: analyst computed a multiple\\nthat reflects the past pricing of a company’s peer group. “Both comparisons”:\\nanalyst made both comparisons. Top number in each cell is the percent relative to\\nthe total for the column. e.g., 46of91reports in 2004 described using a multiple\\nbased on a company’s own past pricing, 46/91=50.5%.\\nThere is every reason to believe that analysts are capable of calculating\\na forward-looking multiple. They regularly perform calculations that are far\\nmore involved than E[EPS]×\\x001\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x01\\n. Table 6 shows that they performed “sum\\nof the parts (SOTP)” analysis in 9.6%of our sample ( 49of513 reports). For\\nexample, Figure 7 shows an October 2019 earnings report about Amazon from\\nWolfe Research. The analyst who wrote this report, Chris Bottiglieri, used a\\ndifferent multiple to value each line of Amazon’s business.\\nLikewise, analysts use multiple multiples in 38.8%of our sample ( 199of513\\nreports). For example, Figure 8 shows an April 2010 coverage-initiation report\\nabout Avis Budget written by an All-American analyst, Himanshu Patel. It is\\na thorough report by a high-quality analyst, and the price target has nothing\\nto do with expected discounted payoff. Himanshu Patel uses a combination of\\nbackward-looking multiples.\\nSell-side analysts have played a critical role in the asset-pricing literature,\\nand “price equals expected discounted payoff” is the bedrock of every asset-\\npricing model. It is problematic that this particular group of market participants\\ntypically does not discount their own expected payoffs.\\n17\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\nFigure 7.

What’s more,\\nthis statistic includes any report that mentions the terms “DCF” or “Discounted\\nCash Flow” in the methods section. Green, Hand, and Zhang (2016) notes that, in\\nroughly 91% of reports that use these keywords, “there is no recognizable DCF\\nmodel provided in the report itself.” Many reports that talk about DCF modeling\\ndo so using boilerplate language without providing any specifics.\\nWhat’s more, analysts rarely use a discount model in isolation ( 5.5%of the\\ntime; just 28reports). 19of these 28discount-model-only reports were written\\nby three analysts at Credit Suisse. In many ways, the 19DCF-only reports are\\nthe worst pieces of research in our sample. The methods section in Figure 9\\nis not even a complete sentence. When we compare with Table 6, we see that\\nanalysts were more likely to use multiple multiples ( 38.8%of reports) than to\\nuse any sort of discounting model ( 30.2%of reports).\\nPrior to examining the data, we anticipated that analysts would be more\\nlikely to use a DCF model in coverage-initiation reports. After all, many of the 174\\nreports in our sample were written about newly public firms with little historical\\ndata. However , the “All Am” column in Table 7 shows that DCF analysis is even\\n19\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\nFigure 8.

Only one in five coverage-initiation\\nreports make use of a discount model in any capacity ( 34of174reports; 19.5%).\\nThe All-American analysts who are responsible for these reports often talk\\nabout DCF models as a second-best option. For example, Figure 10 shows a\\ncoverage-initiation report about Pacific Biosciences (PACB) from December\\n2010. In the methods section of his report, the lead analyst explains that while\\n“multiple-based valuations (e.g., P/E and EV/EBITDA) are common in the life sci-\\nence tools industry,” he has “chosen to use a DCF methodology” out of necessity.\\n20\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\nFigure 9.

Researchers assume that $1·𝑚bad=\\x00$1\\n1+𝑟bad\\x01>\\x00$1\\n1+𝑟good\\x01=$1·𝑚good since that is when they will really need the\\nmoney. When an asset’s expected returns are unusually low, researchers figure\\n23\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\nFigure 11.

The lead analyst on this report was Mike Mayo.\\nthat most of its future payoffs must arrive in some sort of bad state of the world\\nthat investors do not discount very much. The only question is which one?\\nOn one hand, our results are consistent with Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta,\\nand Shleifer (2024), which argues that differences in expected returns are not\\ncompensation for bearing exotic state-contingent risks. None of the 513earnings\\nreports in our sample described anything remotely similar to the above logic.\\nWe do not expect market participants to use terms like “stochastic discount\\nfactor”, but investors must be able to formulate certain basic ideas for the SDF\\napproach to work. Investors can buy a stock that offers insurance against bad\\ntimes without knowing it. But textbook models predict that this stock will have\\nlow expected returns because investors bid up its current price on account of\\nthis insurance value. Investors cannot do this by accident.\\nBut, on the other hand, we also find very little evidence that expected re-\\nturns are compensation for simple risk either . Instead, sell-side analysts often\\nsay that their next-twelve-month return forecast is derived from their beliefs\\nabout a company’s short-term earnings growth rate. For example, Figure 13\\nshows a coverage-initiation report written by Brian Tunick about Chico’s FAS\\nin May 2015. At the top of the first page, he predicts “mid-to high-teens total\\nreturns...comprised of 15% EPS CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from\\n2015–2017E and a ∼2%dividend yield”.\\n24\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\n(c) Valuation summary\\nFigure 12.

The lead analyst on this report was Brian\\nTunick, a member of Institutional Investor magazine’s All-American team.\\n26\\nThis is precisely what we would expect from an analyst who thought about\\na company’s price mainly in terms of trailing P/E ratios. Suppose an analyst\\ncalculates his price targets, E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡, using a\\ntrailing twelve-month P/E, TrailingPE𝑡=Price𝑡/EPS𝑡. In that case, we could\\nrewrite his one-year-ahead return forecasts as\\nE𝑡[Return𝑡+1]=\\x12E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x13\\n+E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]\\nPrice𝑡(6a)\\n=\\x12E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×\\x00Price𝑡\\nEPS𝑡\\x01−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x13\\n+E𝑡[DivYield 𝑡+1] (6b)\\n=\\x12E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]\\nEPS𝑡−1\\x13\\n+E𝑡[DivYield 𝑡+1] (6c)\\nThis is extremely similar to the way that Brian Tunick made his return forecast\\nfor Chico’s FAS. The main difference is that his “ ∼2%dividend yield” was a\\ntrailing average rather than an expected value. More on this shortly.\\n1.6 Subjective Expectations Do Not Respect Identities\\nAsset-pricing researchers assume that Brian Tunick’s price target for Chico’s\\nFAS (CHS) came from asking: “How much are the rights to CHS’s expected future\\nearnings worth in today’s dollars?” Instead, he thought to himself: “If right\\nnow a company reported the earnings I expect CHS to generate in two years,\\nhow would this comparable firm be priced given recent multiples?” Given his\\napproach, there is no reason why Brian Tunick’s price target would respect\\nforward-looking accounting identities.\\nResearchers think it is completely natural to replace the Price𝑡+1on the\\nright-hand side of Equation (1)withE𝑡+1[Dividend 𝑡+2]+E𝑡+1[Price𝑡+2]\\n1+𝑟and then swap\\nout the Price𝑡+2in the resulting expression withE𝑡+2[Dividend 𝑡+3]+E𝑡+2[Price𝑡+3]\\n1+𝑟and\\nso on. . . This is where the dividend discount model in Equation (3)comes from.\\nBut, if analysts do not set price equal to expected discounted payoff, there is no\\nreason for them to enforce consistency between an asset’s current price and\\nthe discounted value of their price target.\\n27\\nAsset-pricing researchers often try to understand the asset-pricing implica-\\ntions of biased subjective beliefs by plugging analyst earnings forecasts from\\nIBES into Campbell and Shiller (1988)’s log-linear approximation for\\x001\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x01\\nPrice𝑡\\nDividend 𝑡≈\\x12\\n1\\n𝑒Í∞\\nℎ=0𝜌ℎ·E𝑡[𝑟(𝑡+ℎ)+1]−Í∞\\nℎ=0𝜌ℎ·E𝑡[ΔlogDividend(𝑡+ℎ)+1]\\x13\\n(7)\\nIn his own textbook, John Campbell explains how Equation (7)should “hold ex\\nante, not only for rational expectations but also for irrational expectations that\\nrespect identities. (Campbell, 2017)” If sell-side analysts’ price targets do not\\nrespect identities, it is not clear what we learn from this exercise.\\nNotice the tension between Andrea Teixeira’s trading recommendation in\\nFigure 14 and her backward-looking multiple. She gave Pepsi an “Overweight”\\nrating, meaning that “[she] expected [the company to] outperform the average\\ntotal return of the other stocks in [her] coverage universe. (JP Morgan, 2019b)”\\nYet, even though Ms Teixeira thought Pepsi’s past price was too low, she still\\nused a backward-looking 24×P/E ratio to create her price target.\\nThe numbers in earnings reports often do not mean what researchers think\\nthey mean. In many cases, they are computed in a way that suggests the analysis\\nmust be approaching the problem differently. For example, Figure 14(c) shows\\na table of key metrics from an October 2019 earnings report written by Andrea\\nTeixeira about Pepsi. The row highlighted in blue shows Pepsi’s share price in\\nOctober 2019, Price Oct‘19=$138.23, divided by its EPS in a given year\\n24.4×=$138.23\\n$5.66=Price Oct‘19\\nEPS ‘18(FY18A)\\n25.1×=$138.23\\n$5.52=Price Oct‘19\\nE[EPS ‘19](FY19E)\\n23.2×=$138.23\\n$5.95=Price Oct‘19\\nE[EPS ‘20](FY20E)\\n21.6×=$138.23\\n$6.41=Price Oct‘19\\nE[EPS ‘21](FY21E)\\nThis is exactly the sort of P/E ratio one would expect from someone who is\\nthinking about how a company’s future earnings would be priced under current\\n28\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\n(c) Table of key metrics\\nFigure 14.

No researcher would report these numbers as coming from\\nthe same variable in an academic paper . You probably would never even think\\nto perform this calculation. And we think this is one reason why researchers\\nhave previously overlooked this glaring piece of evidence.\\nSkeptical? Let’s run an experiment. Go back to page 3 in the introduction. In\\nFigure 2, Chris Horvers calculated the P/E ratios in his valuation matrix just\\nlike Andrea Teixeira. Did you notice? Home Depot’s closing price on December\\n11th 2019 was $212.00, and the P/E ratios in Chris Horvers’ valuation matrix\\ncorrespond to 21.4×=Price Dec‘19\\nEPS ‘18=$212.00\\n$9.89,21.1×=Price Dec‘19\\nE[EPS ‘19]=$212.00\\n$10.05,20.2×=\\nPrice Dec‘19\\nE[EPS ‘20]=$212.00\\n$10.48, and 18.4×=Price Dec‘19\\nE[EPS ‘21]=$212.00\\n$11.50. We would never have thought\\nto look for this calculation prior to writing this paper . Our guess is that, before\\nreading our paper , the thought had not crossed your mind either .\\n1.7 Analysts Price Expected EPS Not Expected Payoffs\\nAsset-pricing textbooks assume that analysts care about earnings because\\nthese cash flows allow a firm to pay dividends. Given this prediction, it is\\nnoteworthy how few of the earnings reports discuss a company’s dividend\\npayout rate. Table 4 shows that analysts mention a company’s dividend yield in\\njust6.4%of all reports ( 33of513).\\nWhile most analysts do not use any sort of present-value model, those that\\ndo tend to compute the present discounted value of a company’s cash flows not\\nits dividend payouts to shareholders. Outside of a few special cases, analysts\\nconsistently ignore a company’s plowback rate. Suppose that two firms have the\\nsame future earnings stream, but one pays out a much larger dividend. Most\\nanalysts would assign both firms the same price target. The December 2019\\nWells Fargo report about Citigroup in Figure 11 is one of the few reports that\\nspecifically talks about using a dividend discount model.\\nWhen analysts do mention a company’s dividend yield, they typically only\\nuse it to compute their return forecast. Dividends rarely play a role in setting\\nprice targets. In short, analysts “track capital gains and dividends as separate\\nand largely independent variables. (Hartzmark and Solomon, 2019)”\\n30\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\nFigure 15. Earning report about Chevron Corp, which was published on November\\n1st 2011 by Argus Research. The lead analyst on this report was Philip Weiss.\\nFigure 15 shows a November 2011 report about Chevron Corp written\\nby Philip Weiss. In the methods section of his report, Mr Weiss says that he\\nconsidered both trailing multiples analysis as well as a DCF model when setting\\nPriceTarget𝑡=$130 , which was 24% higher than Chevron’s current price,\\n$105.05. But he did not make any reference to Chevron’s dividend yield when\\njustifying his price target.\\nChevron’s dividend yield only showed up when Mr Weiss made his “buy”\\nrecommendation. Chevron had paid a dividend of $3.12per share to each\\nshareholder in 2011. Mr Weiss argued that an investor should expect Chevron’s\\nreturns to reflect both the 24% capital gain implied by his price target as well\\nas the company’s trailing-twelve-month dividend yield,$3.12\\n$105.05≈3%,\\nE𝑡[Return𝑡+1]\\n27%=\\x12PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x13\\n($130.00−$105.05)/$105.05≈24%+\\x12\\nDividend 𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x13\\n$3.12/$105.05≈3%(8)\\n31\\nIt might at first seem like Mr Weiss was following textbook logic, but the\\nnature of these two differences shows that he was not. A company’s expected\\nreturn should be equal to its expected capital gain plus its expected dividend\\nyield, E𝑡[Return𝑡+1]=\\x10\\nE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x11\\n+\\x10\\nE𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]\\nPrice𝑡\\x11\\n, but this is not what Mr\\nWeiss calculated in Equation (8). His price target was based on trailing multiples,\\nand he used Chevron’s trailing twelve-month (TTM) dividend yield rather than\\nits expected dividend yield next year , Dividend 𝑡≠E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1].\\nMr Weiss did not just deviate from textbook logic. He did the precise opposite.\\nOn the first page of his report, he predicts that Chevron’s dividend yield will\\ngrow 8.80% over the next twelve months. Yet he still used a trailing dividend\\nyield to calculate a 27% expected return. That is not a mistake. It is a choice.\\n1.8 Do Analysts Give Credible Descriptions?\\nWe have talked to a number of sell-side analysts. Based on these conver-\\nsations, our general sense is that the methods section contains a brief honest\\naccount of how they actually compute their price targets. Researchers are\\nclearly comfortable using analysts’ numerical forecast values. If these numbers\\nrepresent a credible data source, we see no reason to discard the data about\\nhow analysts calculated them. Why should “ 4” be any more worthy of study\\nthan “two times two”?\\nMoreover, even if an analyst does not put in much effort when writing\\nthe methods section of their report, this fact should not push them towards\\ndescriptions of tailing P/E ratios rather than discounted cash flows. It is just as\\neasy to give a brief account of either approach. Many DCF-only reports have a\\none-line methods section (see Figure 9).\\nIt is true that analysts are more likely to include a price target in an earnings\\nreport when they are optimistic about a company’s future prospects (Brav and\\nLehavy, 2003). However , while this fact introduces an upward bias into analysts’\\nprice targets, it has no implications for the way that analysts describe their\\napproach. It is just as easy to plug a small 𝑟into\\x001\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x01\\nas it is to cherry-pick a\\nfavorable trailing window when calculating a P/E.\\n32\\nUnlike an active investor with a profitable trading rule, a sell-side analyst\\nhas no incentive to hide their pricing rule. If anything, their incentives point in\\nthe opposite direction. Sell-side analysts are in the business of writing research\\narticles that advertise how thoroughly they understand a company’s fundamen-\\ntals and future prospects. Misleading their readership about which pricing rule\\nthey are using does not help them accomplish this goal.\\n1.9 Is Our Data Sample Representative?\\nA recent working paper , Décaire and Graham (2024), analyzes a much larger\\ndata set and finds a similar point estimate. This paper uses machine-learning\\ntechniques to analyze the discount rates reported in a collection of 78.5k earn-\\nings reports. When describing their sample, the authors acknowledge that only\\n“40% of all reports available on Refinitiv since 2009” include a DCF model. Thus,\\nthe78.5k earnings reports in that study are analogous to the subset of 155\\nreports in our sample where the analyst talks about using a DCF model in some\\ncapacity. This is a highly non-representative sample.\\nAnother recent working paper , Gormsen and Huber (2024), employed a team\\nof research assistants to analyze what managers said to sell-side analysts in 74k\\nquarterly earnings conference calls. Just like before, the authors find that most\\nconference calls do not make any reference to present-value logic. Select $1at\\nrandom from the total value of the US stock market. There is a greater than 60%\\nchance that this $1came from a firm that has never mentioned a discount rate\\ninanyconference call over the past two decades. The same ballpark 40% value\\nshows up again. These papers show how infrequently DCF models are used.\\n1.10 Do Other Investors Think Like Analysts?\\nThere are good reasons to believe that sell-side analysts are not the only ones\\nusing trailing P/Es. Again, it is called sell-side research for a reason. Presumably\\nthere are other investors interested in buying this research output. Sell-side\\nanalysts have been around in something resembling their current form since\\n33\\nRegulatory filings tend to use multiples analysis for valuations\\n# ReportsDiscount\\nModelMultiples\\nAnalysisBoth Ap-\\nproaches\\nAll Public Firms 8-K 628,446 17.3% 93.2% 10.5%\\nFirms Going Private SC 13E3 5,410 75.1% 93.4% 68.5%\\nPublic Acquirers SC TO-T 4,953 19.9% 91.7% 11.6%\\nM&A Targets SC 14D9 4,084 59.7% 90.3% 50.0%\\nActivist Shareholders SC 13D 9,674 17.3% 90.4% 7.8%\\nPassive Blockholders SC 13G 9,562 1.7% 98.3% 0.0%\\nFund Managers NPORT-P 36,520 39.9% 88.2% 28.1%\\nTotal (w/o 8-Ks) 70,203 34.0% 90.6% 24.7%\\nTotal 698,649 19.0% 92.9% 11.9%\\nTable 8.

Given how long the company has lasted, it would\\nbe odd if no one had ever seen someone using a MacBook.\\nWe also examine price calculations in seven different kinds of SEC regulatory\\nfilings from January 2001 through November 2023: (1) 8-K; a public company\\nmust submit one of these “current report” forms any time a major event takes\\nplace. (2) SC 13E3; a public company must file this form when going private.\\n(3) SC TO-T; a public company must file this form when it makes a tender\\noffer for another company’s shares as part of a takeover bid. (4) SC 14D9; the\\ntarget of this takeover bid must file its response to the tender offer using this\\nform. (5) SC 13D; an investor must file this “beneficial ownership” form within\\n10days of acquiring ownership of ≥5%of a company’s stock. (6) SC 13G;\\nthis is an abbreviated version of form SC 13D, which is often used by large\\npassive investors. (7) NPORT-P; 1940-Act funds use this form to report holdings,\\nperformance, assets under management, etc on a quarterly basis.\\n34\\nThe last row of Table 8 shows that only 19.0%of all valuation-related forms\\nin our sample included any of the following terms: “DCF”, “discounted cash”,\\n“beta”, “WACC”, or “present value”. By contrast, we find that 92.9%of these\\nforms included the term “multiples” or “comparables”.\\n8-K filings make up 628k/698k=90% of all valuation-related filings in our\\nsample. So you might worry our results are being skewed by this one particular\\nkind of form. But the second-to-last row of Table 8 should allay this concern.\\nWhen we look at the remaining 70k observations, only 34.0%mention any sort\\nof discount model while 90.6%talk about multiples analysis.\\n1.11 Where Do Researchers Go From Here?\\nSuppose that, for the sake of argument, sell-side analysts were the only ones\\nusing trailing P/E ratios. Even if all other investors set price equal to expected\\ndiscounted payoff, researchers do not get to observe these other investors’\\nsubjective beliefs. Much of what researchers think they know about discount\\nrates comes from studying analysts’ earnings forecasts. Our findings show that,\\nfor the most part, analysts do not use one.\\nSell-side analysts describe their price-forecasting problem in an entirely\\ndifferent way than an academic researcher would. The day-to-day business\\nof being an asset-pricing theorist involves writing down models of expected\\nreturns. They assume that investors use the model-implied expected return as\\ntheir discount rate when setting price levels.\\nOf the 155reports in our sample that mentioned a DCF or dividend discount\\nmodel, the majority never specify which discount rate was used. Philip Weiss\\nsaid he used a DCF model to set a price target for Chevron in his November\\n2011 report. This document contained nearly 200exact numerical values. For\\neach trailing multiple he listed in Figure 15(b), Mr Weiss gave both the precise\\nvalue as well as its historical range. However , at no point in his report did Philip\\nWeiss bother to say which discount rate he used to calculate\\x001\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x01\\n.\\nWith𝑁≥3observations, it is always possible to estimate a cross-sectional\\nregression,𝑌𝑛∼ˆ𝛼+ˆ𝛽·𝑋𝑛+𝜖𝑛. But every researcher recognizes that ˆ𝛽≠0does not\\n35\\nimply a causal relationship between 𝑋and𝑌. Likewise, there is nothing stopping\\na researcher from estimating the best-fit discount rate implied by analysts’\\nearnings forecast and a company’s current share price. But the existence of this\\nfitted value does not imply that analysts are using it to set target prices or form\\nexpectations. It is clear from reading analysts’ reports that they are not. This is\\nnot a solid enough foundation to build our entire field around.\\nResearchers have found that analyst-implied discount rates are consistent\\nwith the intertemporal capital asset-pricing model (ICAPM; Pástor, Sinha, and\\nSwaminathan, 2008), international asset-pricing models (Lee, Ng, and Swami-\\nnathan, 2009), and the pricing of default risk (Chava and Purnanandam, 2010).\\nBut if analysts are not actually using these implied discount rates to price assets,\\nwhere is the close empirical fit coming from? It is possible to accidentally buy\\ninsurance against a future risk, but investors cannot accidentally assign the\\ncorrect price to this insurance (Chinco, Hartzmark, and Sussman, 2022).\\nIt is hard to escape the conclusion that researchers are modeling a problem\\nthat does not matter to sell-side analysts in the real world. Textbook models\\nsay that investors equate a company’s share price with its expected discounted\\npayoff to each shareholder . Financial economists think about the discount rate\\nembedded in this pricing rule as the most important part of the problem. By\\ncontrast, the analysts in our sample focus all their attention on predicting a\\ncompany’s earnings. They pick a recent P/E almost as an afterthought.\\nWhile the behavioral-finance literature has spent most of its time looking\\nfor biases in analysts’ EPS forecasts, at least analysts are trying hard to get those\\nnumbers right. In contrast, they are not even trying to calculate the expected\\ndiscounted payoff at the heart of every standard asset-pricing model. This seems\\nlike the bigger issue.\\nWe appreciate that every profession does some things on autopilot. For ex-\\nample, financial economists often cluster their standard errors without thinking\\ntoo carefully about how they do it (Petersen, 2008). The surprising thing is that\\nanalysts so pay little attention to the thing (the “P” in the P/E ratio) asset-pricing\\nresearchers obsess over . That is noteworthy.\\n36\\n2 A Simple Model\\nWe have just seen that, in addition to telling us their subjective earnings\\nforecasts, sell-side analysts also tell us how they price them. They do not set\\n“price equal to expected discounted payoff”. Our hope is that, the next time you\\nsit down to write an asset-pricing model, you will consider building this model\\non some other “simple concept”. In this section, we provide an example of what\\nsuch a model might look like.\\nIn Subsection 2.1, we start by outlining how a company’s earnings change\\nover time. Then, in Subsection 2.2, we take analysts at their word when they\\ndescribe using a firm’s trailing P/E ratio to set price targets. We model investors\\nwho proportionally adjust their holdings of a firm after looking at the relative\\ndifference between analysts’ price target and the company’s current price.\\nIn Subsection 2.3, we characterize the resulting asset prices. We show that\\nit is possible for PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE to be correct on average\\nbecause prices themselves are mostly backward-looking. Finally, in Subsection\\n2.4, we highlight how our model implies a strong exclusion restriction. For a\\npiece of news to affect a company’s expected return, it must change analysts’\\nshort-term earnings expectations.\\n2.1 Earnings Growth\\nIn textbook models, investors care about earnings only insofar as these\\nearnings translate into future payouts. However , as noted in the previous section,\\nsell-side analysts price earnings for earnings’ sake. So we put earnings per share\\n(EPS) at the center of our model. Study a single company with earnings over the\\npast twelve months, EPS 𝑡, that are governed by the following law of motion\\n\\x12\\nEPS𝑡+1−EPS𝑡\\nEPS𝑡\\x13\\n=𝑋𝑡+𝜖𝑡+1 (9)\\n𝑋𝑡≈E𝑡[ΔlogEPS𝑡+1]is the expected rate at which the company’s earnings will\\ngrow over the next year , and 𝜖𝑡+1IID∼Normal(0,𝜎2)is a noise term.\\n37\\nThink about a firm that had earnings of EPS𝑡=$1.00per share over the past\\nyear . Over the next twelve months, its earnings are expected to grow by 𝑋𝑡=5%\\non average. But investors would not be surprised to see the firm’s earnings\\ngrowth rate by 𝜎=2%pt higher or lower. Given these assumptions, investors\\nexpect the company to generate earnings of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]=$1.05±$0.02for each\\nshareholder over the next year and E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]=$1.11±$0.04the year after .\\nIf we were writing down a traditional asset-pricing model, then the com-\\npany’s current share price would be determined by the expected discounted\\nvalue of its entire future cash-flow stream. In that sort of model, it would be\\nimportant for us to explain how 𝑋𝑡evolves over time as well. But we are not\\nwriting down that sort of model. All that matters is short-term earnings growth,\\nso we have deliberately chosen not to specify the longer-term dynamics.\\n2.2 Investor Demand\\nLetPrice𝑡denote the company’s current price level. At each time 𝑡, the\\nanalysts in our model set a one-year-ahead price target\\nPriceTarget𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡 (10)\\nFor simplicity, we will assume analysts calculate the firm’s trailing P/E ratio\\nusing the past twelve months of data, TrailingPE𝑡def=Price𝑡/EPS𝑡.\\nIn standard asset-pricing models, investors make portfolio decisions to\\nmaximize their expected utility. However , sell-side analysts make explicit trading\\nrecommendations by comparing their price target to a company’s current price.\\nFor example, in an October 2019 report, Kaumil Gajrawala describes how he\\n“[rated] PepsiCo underperform based on its expected return relative to our target\\nprice. (Credit Suisse, 2019)” And analysts’ recommendations can be worth acting\\non (Birru, Gokkaya, Liu, and Stulz, 2022).\\nIn our model, investors compare analysts’ price target to the company’s\\ncurrent price. When the price target is higher,PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡>0%, they tell\\ntheir broker to buy shares over the next year. When the price target is lower,\\n38\\nPriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡<0%, they tell their broker to reduce their position over the\\nupcoming twelve months. Moreover , in both scenarios, investors will send their\\nbroker instructions to buy in proportion to the relative price difference\\n\\x12\\nDemand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡\\nDemand 𝑡\\x13\\n=𝜇·\\x12PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x13\\n(11)\\n𝜇 > 0is a positive constant, which is known as a demand “multiplier”.\\nTo make things concrete, suppose that the company is currently trading at\\nPrice𝑡=$100 and the demand multiplier is 𝜇=1. If analysts set a one-year-\\nahead price target of PriceTarget𝑡=$103 , then investors would respond by\\nincreasing their holdings 1·\\x00$103−$100\\n$100\\x01=3%over the next year. If investors\\ncurrently hold Demand 𝑡=300,000shares. Then, a year from now, they would\\nlike to own Demand 𝑡+1=309,000shares in this example.\\nWe saw in the previous section that, sell-side analysts spend most of their\\ntime fine-tuning their near-term earnings forecast. Then, when it comes time to\\ncapitalize these expected earnings into a price target, they use a trailing P/E. In\\nother words, real-world analysts set price targets by asking themselves: “What\\nwould the firm’s price be at current multiples if it had realized earnings of\\nE𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]rather than EPS𝑡today?” In our model, investors adjust their holdings\\nbased on the thing analysts actually care about.\\nProposition 2.2 (Demand Schedule) .If analysts use trailing P/E ratios to set\\nprice targets (Equation 10) and investors proportionally adjust their holdings\\nover the next year in response (Equation 11), then changes in investors’ demand\\nwill reflect changes in expected short-term earnings growth\\n\\x12\\nDemand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡\\nDemand 𝑡\\x13\\n=𝜇·\\x12E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡\\nEPS𝑡\\x13\\n(12)\\n“Asset-pricing theory all stems from one simple concept: price equals ex-\\npected discounted payoff. The rest is elaboration, special cases, and a closet full\\nof tricks. (Cochrane, 2009, page 1)” Researchers are so used to thinking this way\\nthat many assume it is the only way—i.e., that investor demand must ultimately\\nbe derived from expected discounted payoffs. But it is not so.\\n39\\n2.3 Asset Prices\\nObviously, in a world where sell-side analysts do apply present-value logic,\\nthere is no reason to expect their price targets to line up with the present\\ndiscounted value of a firm’s expected dividend stream. But this does not imply\\nthat their forecasts are wrong. If realized prices do not reflect present-value\\nlogic either , then analysts’ price targets might still be roughly correct.\\nWe now point to a simple assumption about how prices evolve over time\\nthat leads to exactly this sort of scenario. Specifically, we assume that there\\nexists a strictly positive constant, 𝜈>0, such that\\n\\x12\\nPrice𝑡+1−Price𝑡\\nPrice𝑡\\x13\\n=𝜈·\\x12\\nDemand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡\\nDemand 𝑡\\x13\\n+𝜀𝑡+1 (13)\\nThis assumption says that if investors tell their broker to increase their positions\\nby1%over the upcoming year , then the company’s share price with increase by\\n𝜈%on average. The noise term 𝜀𝑡+1IID∼Normal(0,𝜍2)captures all other reasons\\nwhy a company’s share price might increase or decrease next year . Under this\\nassumption, it is possible for analysts’ price targets to be accurate in a world\\nwhere price does not equal expected discounted payoff.\\nProposition 2.3 (Correct On Average) .Suppose that investors choose their\\ndemand according to Equation (11) and that realized price growth is governed by\\nthe law of motion in Equation (13). If𝜈=1/𝜇, then\\nˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡 (14)\\nwhere ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]is the average price next year observed by an econometrician.\\nThis result follows a long tradition in theoretical asset pricing: guess that the\\nprice function is linear and then verify that the implications are consistent with\\nsome goal. For example, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) guessed that a risky asset’s\\nprice would be a linear function of a signal about the asset’s future payout and\\nan aggregate supply shock, Price =𝐴+𝐵·Signal−𝐶·Shock . The authors figured\\nout what this price function “implied for risky asset demand, substituted that\\n40\\ndemand function into the market-clearing condition, and matched coefficients\\nto verify their [initial] hypothesis (Veldkamp, 2011)” about the price function\\nbeing linear . We are doing something similar . But, instead of guessing that prices\\nare linear , we match coefficients to verify that price growth is linear .\\nAnalysts say that they set price targets by multiplying a company’s expected\\nEPS times a trailing P/E as shown in Equation (10). They also explain how their\\ntrading recommendations come from comparing a company’s price target for\\nnext year to its current price level as shown in Equation (11). Given these two\\nstarting points, it is not surprising that there exists some price path under which\\nit makes sense to use trailing P/E ratios.\\nThe surprising thing is that the price path in Equation (13) is so simple.\\nThe functional forms used by Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) were dictated by\\ntheoretical considerations. They chose to study a CARA-normal setting because,\\nin that sort of model, it would be natural to expect prices to be linear . By contrast,\\nthe functional forms in our model are dictated by what real-world market\\nparticipants say. Nevertheless, we are still able to outline a simple scenario in\\nwhich PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE is correct on average.\\nIt is also noteworthy that the law of motion for prices (Equation 13) involves\\nthe same sort of proportional thinking found in investors’ demand rule (Equa-\\ntion 11). It makes sense to use E[EPS]×TrailingPE when investors’ demand\\nand price growth both respond proportionally.\\nThis connects our work to the literature on demand-system asset pricing\\n(Koijen and Yogo, 2019; Gabaix and Koijen, 2024). Equations (11) and (13) are\\nwritten down in percentage changes, so 𝜇and𝜈can be seen as a demand\\nmultiplier and a price elasticity. Under this interpretation, it would be natural\\nto expect𝜇=1/𝜈as required by Proposition 2.3.\\nThat being same, our model focuses on demand multipliers and price elas-\\nticities for a very different reason. The demand-system framework cares about\\n𝜇and𝜈because they play a pivotal role in models where investors solve a\\nforward-looking portfolio problem and appreciate the implications of market\\nclearing. By contrast, our model does not enforce market clearing. 𝜇and𝜈\\nemerge from taking seriously how analysts describe their pricing rule.\\n41\\n2.4 Exclusion Restriction\\nPresent-value relationships are valuable because they rule out lots of pos-\\nsible mechanisms. Let News𝑡be a piece of information revealed about a firm\\nat time𝑡. If this is how the world works, then News𝑡can only predict the com-\\npany’s future returns if it is correlated with changes in investors’ cash-flow\\nexpectations or their discount rate. All price effects must operate through these\\ntwo specific channels.\\n“In general, the claim that an instrument operates through a single known\\nchannel is called an exclusion restriction . (Angrist and Pischke, 2009)” Our\\nframework implies its own very different kind of exclusion restriction: if News𝑡\\npredicts the company’s future return, then it must be correlated with the firm’s\\nnear-term expected earnings growth. It does not help to be correlated with\\nother future outcomes that would matter in textbook models.\\nProposition 2.4 (Exclusion Restriction) .IfNews𝑡is uncorrelated with expected\\nshort-run earnings growth, \\x9aCorr(𝑋𝑡,News𝑡)=0, it will not predict average returns\\n\\x9aCorr\\x00\\nReturn𝑡+1,News𝑡\\x01=0 (15)\\nThis is true even if News𝑡is correlated with expected earnings growth at some\\npoint farther in the future, \\x9aCorr(𝑋𝑡+ℎ,News𝑡)≠0forℎ≥1, or the discount rate\\nthat a forward-looking present-value investor would use, \\x9aCorr(𝑟𝑡+ℎ,News𝑡)≠0.\\nResearchers typically focus on things that *should* affect prices. An asset-\\npricing model’s key predictions usually come from digging into the economic\\nforces that determine the key parameters. Think about Grossman and Stiglitz\\n(1980). The main predictions in that paper came from understanding the coeffi-\\ncient𝐵in the pricing rule Price =𝐴+𝐵·Signal−𝐶·Shock . The authors showed\\nthat, if more investors were to buy the private signal and become informed, the\\n𝐵coefficient would get larger , resulting in a negative feedback loop.\\nBy contrast, the interesting thing about our model is all the things that\\n*should not* affect prices. News cannot change the past. The firm’s trailing P/E\\nratio is what it is. The only way a piece of news can alter investors’ demand (and\\n42\\n(a) Top of first page\\n(b) Methods section\\nFigure 16. Earning report about AT&T published on May 20th 2010 by BTIG. The\\nlead analyst on this report was Walter Piecyk, a member of Institutional Investor\\nmagazine’s All-American research team.\\nthus the equilibrium price) in our model is by changing the one forward-looking\\ncomponent: expected earnings growth over the next two years.\\nDo analysts really ignore information about a company’s earnings three\\nyears from now? Yes. Figure 16 shows a May 2010 coverage-initiation report\\nabout AT&T written by Walter Piecyk, which describes this exact reasoning.\\nWalter Piecyk recognizes that AT&T’s earnings will plummet in three years when\\nthe company loses its exclusive contract for iPhones. So he concludes: “But that’s\\njust it. The EPS disaster we foretell is in 2012. . . [making it] fairly challenging to\\nconstruct a valuation target that would generate enough downside to merit a\\nSell rating.” AT&T’s fiscal year 2012 was two years after Mr Piecyk’s target date\\nat the time he wrote his report in May 2010—i.e., (𝑡+3)in model time.\\n43\\n3 Explanatory Power\\nIn this section, we show that trailing P/E ratios have a substantial amount of\\nexplanatory power . We describe our data in Subsection 3.1. Then, in Subsection\\n3.2 we document how PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE can explain over 91%\\nof the variation in analysts’ price targets. In Subsection 3.3 we show that this\\nsimple formula also explains how market prices respond to earnings surprises.\\n3.1 Data description\\nWe use data from IBES and the merged CRSP/Compustat daily file. We restrict\\nour sample to common stocks (share codes 10and 11) traded on NYES, Nasdaq,\\nor AmEx during the period from 2003 to 2022. For the reasons discussed above,\\nwe exclude firms in the following six Fama-French industries: real estate, coal,\\nsteel, mines, oil, and gold.\\nAnalysts set price targets for a company at the end of the upcoming fiscal year .\\nWe refer to this future date as the “target date” and denote it with (𝜏+1). For\\nexample, Chris Horvers wrote a report in December 2019 that set a price target\\nof$241 for Home Depot in December 2020 (target date). We distinguish between\\ntrading days 𝑡and target dates 𝜏because an analyst can revise his/her forecast\\nfor the same target date on successive trading days. For each analyst 𝑎tracking\\na particular firm 𝑛, we record their most recent price target, PriceTarget𝑎\\n𝑛,𝑡=\\nE𝑎\\n𝑡[Price𝑛,𝜏+1], from 18months to 6months prior to each target date (𝜏+1).\\nWe write the analyst’s corresponding EPS forecast as E𝑎\\n𝑡[EPS𝑛]. We use the\\ntwo-year-ahead EPS forecast when available in IBES, E𝑎\\n𝑡[EPS𝑛,𝜏+2], otherwise we\\nuse the one-year-ahead value, E𝑎\\n𝑡[EPS𝑛,𝜏+1]. We restrict our sample to include\\nobservations with a positive EPS forecast, E𝑎\\n𝑡[EPS𝑛]≥$0.01. We also require\\nfirms to have a price target greater than $1and less than $10,000.\\nThe resulting panel data set is organized by firm ×analyst×target date.\\nFigures 3 and 6 show what this panel looks like Chris Horvers’ coverage of Home\\nDepot and Andrea Teixeira’s coverage of Coca-Cola (KO).

We only\\nrequire 4quarters of trailing EPS data when estimating Table 11; whereas, the\\nregression in Figure 19 requires a firm to have 20quarters of trailing EPS data.\\nThe fact thatÍ4\\nℓ=1ˆ𝜃ℓ=0.50<0.58suggests that analysts incorporate trailing\\ninformation from previous years when such information is available.\\n50\\n3.3 Realized Price Changes\\nIn the final part of our empirical analysis, we show that trailing P/E ratios\\ndo not just explain the future prices that analysts expect. They also explain the\\nrealized prices that we later observe in the data. To provide the cleanest possible\\nempirical setting, we study how a company’s share price changes following an\\nearnings surprise.\\nTo see the logic behind our test, imagine that a company just announced\\nquarterly earnings that were +$0.10per share higher than analysts’ expectations.\\nIt does not take a genius to predict that the firm’s price will likely go up. But\\nwhy? What are the possible mechanisms?\\nTo start with, suppose we lived in a world were analysts used a Gordon\\nmodel to price each company’s expected future earnings stream\\nPrice𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]×\\x12\\n1\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x13\\n(20)\\nThis is just Equation (4)but with EPS in place of dividends. In this scenario,\\nthere are two ways that a +$0.10per share earnings surprise could cause a\\ncompany’s price to increase. Short-term earnings expectations could rise—i.e.,\\nhigher E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]. There could also be multiples expansion—i.e., larger\\x001\\n𝑟−𝑔\\x01\\n.\\nMoreover , investors should be more likely to change their multiple following a\\nlarge earnings surprise, which often signal important long-term changes.\\nBy contrast, our model says that the price change should be proportional to\\nthe firm’s trailing P/E ratio at the time of its +$0.10per share earnings surprise\\nΔPrice𝑡+1={𝜆·$0.10}×TrailingPE𝑡 for some𝜆 >0 (21)\\nGood news cannot change the past. The company’s trialing P/E is set in stone. A\\npositive+$0.10per share earnings surprise this quarter will only cause analysts\\nto increase their EPS forecast for the year by +$0.10. This will push their price\\ntarget up by ΔPriceTarget𝑡=$0.10×TrailingPE𝑡, and the company’s share price\\nwill grow in response to the resulting increase in investor demand.\\n51\\nWe cannot predict the value of 𝜆based on first principles. But we can\\nestimate this parameter using the available data. The same 𝜆should apply\\nregardless of whether the firm announces earnings that are +$0.10higher than\\nexpected (like we have considered so far) or +$0.30higher than expected. It\\nalso should not matter if the firm falls short of analysts’ expectations by −$0.20\\nper share. It should be the same constant of proportionality in all cases.\\nFirst, we group stock-quarter observations by the size of their earnings\\nsurprise,𝑠∈{− $0.30,..., $0.30}, which we define relative to the consensus\\nforecast. Then, within each bucket, we run a separate regression to estimate the\\nrelationship between a stock’s trailing P/E ratio and its subsequent price change\\nΔPrice𝑛,𝑞+1∼ˆ𝜅𝑠+ˆ𝜆𝑠·TrailingPE𝑛,𝑞using data on firm-qtr\\nobs where(𝑛,𝑞)∈𝑁𝑠(22)\\nwhere𝑁𝑠={(𝑛,𝑞):eps𝑛,𝑞−E𝑡Ancmt−1[eps𝑛,𝑞]=𝑠}is the set of stock-quarter\\nobservations where the firm announced had a 𝑠dollar per share earnings\\nsurprise. This gives us 60distinct estimates for 𝜆·𝑠. Finally, we check whether\\nthese estimated values all share a key property, ˆ𝜆𝑠/𝑠=𝜆.\\nNotice how this approach mirrors the standard logic behind textbook asset-\\npricing econometrics. For example, think about the Fama and MacBeth (1973)\\napproach to testing the CAPM. First, you group stocks into portfolios. Then,\\nyou estimate each portfolio’s market beta, 𝛽, by running a separate time-series\\nregression. Finally, you check whether there is a linear relationship between\\neach portfolio’s excess returns and its estimated 𝛽.\\nAverage excess returns and market betas do not line up neatly on the security\\nmarket line as predicted by the CAPM. But Figure 20 shows that our estimated\\nslope coefficients,{ˆ𝜆𝑠}, do increase linearly in the size of the underlying earnings\\nsurprise,𝑠. The black dots show the coefficients associated with 60different\\nlevels of earnings surprise: 𝑠∈{− $0.30,...,−$0.01,$0.01,..., $0.30}per share.\\nWe omit the 𝑠=$0.00bin where there is no surprise.\\nWhen a firm announces quarterly earnings that way above or below analysts’\\nconsensus expectation, it is often a sign that something important has changed\\nabout the firm’s situation. Large surprises often signal a persistent change in the\\n52\\n-$0.10-$0.05$0.00$0.05$0.10\\n-$0.30 -$0.20 -$0.10 $0.00 $0.10 $0.20 $0.30ˆ𝜆𝑠Price Response To Dollar Earnings Surprise\\n𝑠→ˆ𝜆𝑠∼0𝑌00\\n±0𝑌01+0𝑌19\\n±0𝑌02·𝑠Figure 20.

Hence, in a world where investors were following\\ntextbook logic, we would expect to see them use larger multiples following very\\npositive earnings surprises and smaller multiples after very negative surprises.\\nHence, in a textbook world, we would not find a neat linear relationship like\\nthe one we see in Figure 20. Instead, we should see an “S”-shaped pattern or even\\nsomething that looks like a sine wave. If stock 𝐴hasTrailingPE𝐴=20×while\\nstock𝐵hasTrailingPE𝐴=10×, then maybe stock 𝐴might have double the price\\nreaction for small earnings surprises. But, for large surprises, forward-looking\\ninvestors would revise their choice of multiple to reflect persistent changes,\\nmeaning that the difference between stock 𝐴and stock𝐵should attenuate in\\nthe tails. We do not see that happen.\\nOur 0.19second-stage slope coefficient implies that, following an 𝑠=$0.10\\nper share earnings surprise, the share price of stock 𝐴with TrailingPE𝐴=20×\\nwill increase by $0.19=0.19·{$0.10×20−$0.10×10}more than the share\\nprice of stock 𝐵with TrailingPE𝐵=10×. If both firms had realized an 𝑠=$0.20\\nper share earnings surprise, then stock 𝐴’s share price would have gone up by\\n$0.38more than stock 𝐵’s over the subsequent quarter .

It is exactly as predicted by the exclusion restriction we outline\\nin Proposition 2.4. The trailing P/E is set in stone. A piece of news changes a\\ncompany’s price by altering investors’ short-term earnings expectations.\\nWe know from cross-sectional asset pricing that a researcher’s choice of\\ntest portfolios can effect how well a model appears to fit the data (Lewellen,\\nNagel, and Shanken, 2010). So, in Table 12, we show the results of analogous\\nsecond-stage regressions where we group firm-quarter observations into bins\\nthat are $0.02wide and $0.05wide. We get quantitatively similar results no\\nmatter how finely we divide our portfolios. The intercept is always a precisely\\nestimated zero. This straight line exists because investors are using a trailing\\nP/E ratio to update a firm’s price following earnings surprises.\\n54\\nConclusion\\nInvestors sometimes set price equal to expected discounted payoff. For\\nexample, bond markets are largely governed by present-value logic. Investors\\nalso rely on DCF models in certain niche industries. This is how marine shipping\\nMLPs, mining operations, and REITs typically get valued. However , asset-pricing\\nresearchers currently take it for granted that investors always enforce present-\\nvalue relationships. This is simply not true. Every model should not start with\\nprice equals expected discounted payoff.\\nWe show that sell-side analysts typically do not discount any expected future\\npayoffs when valuing large publicly traded companies. Instead, they capitalize\\ntheir short-term EPS expectations into a price target with a trailing P/E ratio.\\nThe analysts in textbook models ask themselves: “What is the present value of\\na company’s expected future earnings stream in today’s dollars?” Real-world\\nanalysts ask a different question: “How would a comparable firm have been\\nprice last year if it had announced similar earnings?”\\nMarket participants do not usually share their subjective payoff expectations\\nwith us. Sell-side analysts are the exception. As a result, their earnings forecasts\\nhave had a massive impact on the asset-pricing literature. Researchers have\\nspent decades plugging these numbers into various present-value relationships\\nin an effort to understand analysts’ discount rate. However , analysts tell us how\\nthey price their own subjective earnings expectations in the text of their report.\\nMore often than not, it has nothing to do with discount rates. As a rule, they\\ngenerally use a trailing P/E.\\n“Price equals expected discounted payoff” is clearly not a sensible assump-\\ntion to make when modeling sell-side analysts. The next time you write down\\nan asset-pricing model, we want you to consider whether this “one simple\\nconcept” is a sensible assumption in your application. It might not. To show how\\nproductive alternative approaches can be, we build an equilibrium asset-pricing\\nmodel based on PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE . We take this model to the\\ndata and find that it explains both analysts’ price targets and how market prices\\nrespond to earnings announcements.\\n55\\nReferences\\nAngrist, J. and J.-S.
