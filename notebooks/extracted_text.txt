Expected EPS × Trailing P/E

ABSTRACT
All of asset-pricing theory currently stems from one key assumption: price equals expected 
discounted  payoff. And much of what we think we know about discount rates comes from studying 
a particular  kind of expected payoff: the earnings forecasts in analyst reports. Researchers typically 
access these numbers through an easy-to-use database and never read the underlying documents. 
This is unfortunate  because the text of each report contains an explicit description of how the 
analyst priced their own earnings forecast. We study a sample of 513 reports and find that most 
analysts use a trailing P/E (price-to-earnings)  ratio not a discount rate. Instead of computing the 
present value of a company’s future earnings, they ask: “How would a firm with similar earnings 
have been priced last year?” Even if other investors do things differently, it does not make sense to 
put discount rates at the center of every asset-pricing  model if market participants do not always use 
one. There are other options. Trailing twelve-month  P/E ratios account for 91% of the variation in 
analysts’ price targets.We construct a new kind of asset-pricing  model around this fact and show 
that it explains the market response to earnings surprises.

Introduction
At the moment, “asset-pricing theory all stems from one simple concept:
price equals expected discounted payoff. The rest is elaboration, special cases,
and a closet full of tricks. (Cochrane, 2009, page 1)” Researchers are willing
to entertain the idea that investors might have biased subjective beliefs or
hold non-standard preferences. But no one ever questions whether real-world
investors apply present-value logic.
Suppose you buy a share of stock today and then sell it next year after
collecting the dividend. Your total future payoff will be Dividend 𝑡+1+Price𝑡+1.
All standard models assume the current price will be given by something like
Price𝑡=E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]+E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]
1+𝑟(1)
where E𝑡[·]reflects investors’ subjective beliefs about an asset’s payoff next
year and𝑟is the discount rate they apply to these payoffs.
Figure 1 shows a December 2019 report about Home Depot written by Chris
Horvers, a senior analyst at JP Morgan. Chris Horvers starts his report by telling
investors to “Overweight” Home Depot in their portfolios—i.e., buy more shares.
Then, he sets a price target of E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=$241 for Home Depot in December
2020 (one year into the future) based on his view that the company would have
earnings per share (EPS) of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]=$10.48over the next twelve months
(FY2020) and E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]=$11.50the year after (FY2021).
These are the sorts of numbers that researchers are used to downloading
from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (IBES). Given that all asset-
pricing models start with “price equals expected discounted payoff”, researchers
would love to have similar data on all investors’ payoff expectations as well.
Unfortunately, most market participants do not publicly announce their subjec-
tive beliefs. Sell-side analysts do, and as a result their forecasts have had a big
impact on the asset-pricing literature (Kothari, So, and Verdi, 2016).
Researchers are primarily interested in discount rates, and much of what
we think we know about them comes from studying IBES data. Researchers

have spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how analysts discount their
own subjective earnings forecasts. It is common to see researchers estimate an
implied discount rate by replacing the numerator in Equation (1)with analysts’
values of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]+E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]and solving for 𝑟. Researchers frequently
analyze longer-term effects by plugging analysts’ forecasts into Campbell and
Shiller (1988)’s log-linear approximation to Equation (1).
But researchers do not need to figure out how sell-side analysts price their
own earnings forecasts. They describe their approach in the text of each report.
We read what analysts write and find that most do not use a discount rate.
They multiply their short-term earnings forecast times a trailing P/E (price-
to-earnings) ratio. Rather than asking “How much is this company’s expected
earnings worth in today’s dollars?”, they ask “If a firm had reported similar
earnings last year , how would it have been priced given recent multiples?”
Researchers cannot take it for granted that an asset’s price always reflects
its expected discounted payoff. Sometimes financial markets work this way. But
in many important cases they do not. At the end of the day, it does not make
sense to organize our entire field around the concept of discount rates if we
cannot count on investors actually using one. The rest of the paper is about
where we go from here. We model an alternative path forward that reflects
how analysts describe their own pricing rule and show that this model can
explain important patterns in real-world data.

Figure 2. How Chris Horvers described calculating his $241 price target for Home
Depot in his December 2019 earnings report for JP Morgan.
Section 1 examines a sample of 513 sell-side analyst reports, which were
written about large publicly traded companies from 2003 through 2022. These
reports show that most analysts do not take a present-value approach to pricing
their own subjective earnings expectations. Instead, they typically set a com-
pany’s price target, PriceTarget𝑡def=E𝑡[Price𝑡+1], equal to the firm’s expected
short-term earnings times its trailing P/E.
Sell-side research is more than just dry colorless lists of numbers. Analysts
have been required to state their pricing rule in the text of each report since
May 2002 when the SEC passed NASD Rule 2711. The current statute is FINRA
Rule 2241, which says “any recommendation, rating, or price target [must be]
accompanied by a clear explanation of any valuation method used.”
Figure 2 shows the “clear explanation” that Chris Horvers gave in his report.
He could have said that he carefully examined Home Depot’s expected cash-flow
stream from 2021 onward. He could have gone deep into the weeds, outlining
precisely how he discounted these expected future cash flows back to December
2020. He was more than capable of doing this sort of analysis.

Chris Horvers chose not to. He plainly states that his $241 price target for
Home Depot was “based on ∼21.0×our revised 2021E EPS, in line with its
three-year average”

To forecast Home Depot’s share price in December 2020 (end of period 𝑡+1), he
multiplied his EPS forecast for 2021 (period 𝑡+2) times a 3-year trailing average
P/E based on 2017, 2018, and 2019 (periods 𝑡−2,𝑡−1, and𝑡).
It is possible to interpret certain kinds of multiples analysis as special cases
of present-value logic. For example, the classic Gordon model comes from
iterating Equation (1) forward and assuming constant dividend growth
for𝑖=(𝑡+1)to∞:
replace Price𝑖
withE𝑖[Dividend 𝑖+1]+E𝑖[Price𝑖+1]
1+𝑟

The resulting pricing rule in Equation (4)uses a forward-looking multiple, 1

ℎ=1E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+ℎ]
(1+𝑟)ℎ.
E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1], as a shortcut for calculating the
present value of an infinite stream of expected future dividend payments.
While the timing of Equation (2)strongly suggests Chris Horvers has seen
the Gordon model, his underlying economic logic could not be more different.
There is nothing forward-looking about the “Valuation Matrix” in Figure 2.
Chris Horvers’ arrived at his $241 price target by asking himself: “How has
the market typically priced each $1of Home Depot’s earnings during the past
few years?” Moreover , he did this in spite of the fact that he gave Home Depot
an “overweight” rating. Chris Horvers felt the market had been undervaluing
Home Depot and expected the company to experience multiples expansion
going forward. He still used a trailing P/E to set his price target.

Our point is not that Chris Horvers is a bad analyst. Chris Horvers is an
excellent analyst. He has been named to Institutional Investor magazine’s All-
American team multiple times, and his December 2019 report about Home
Depot is the kind of report that other analysts are striving to produce. We greatly
admire Chris Horvers’ work. We think other researchers should actually read it.
There is so much more to sell-side research than the handful of numerical
values found in IBES. Every report includes a detailed explanation showing
how the analyst valued the company. Chris Horvers tells us that he is not setting
price equal to expected discounted payoff, and most other sell-side analysts say
the same thing. As a rule, they do not apply present-value logic when pricing
their own subjective cash-flow expectations.
Frankly, it is surprising that so many papers have been written about biased
earnings forecasts. Analysts put a lot of effort into getting those numbers right.
Chris Horvers spent pages justifying his value of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]=$11.50. Then,
when it came time to capitalize this expected cash flow into a share price, he
did not even attempt to approximateÍ∞
ℎ=1E𝑡[EPS𝑡+ℎ]
(1+𝑟)ℎ. He chose not to apply the
“one simple concept” that is the bedrock of our entire research program.
Researchers are free to continue pretending that price always equals ex-
pected discounted payoff if they want to. You can still use IBES data to estimate
discount rates and perform Campbell and Shiller (1988) decompositions like
nothing has changed. But what would be the point? If the imputed values have
nothing to do with how assets are actually being priced, then they will not be
relevant in the future or helpful for evaluating policy counterfactuals.
Section 2 outlines a productive path forward. In many applications, “price
equals expected discounted payoff” is not a good foundation to build a model
on. If you are interested in modeling how S&P 500 companies get priced and
plan on using IBES data in your empirical work, then you need a theory that
stems from some other “simple concept”. We show what such a model might
look like. Our theory provides a simple rationale for why analysts use trailing
P/E ratios and also generates sharp testable predictions.
Here is how the model works. There is a single stock, and each year analysts
set a one-year-ahead price target. If this price target is higher or lower than
5
the firm’s current share price, then investors proportionally adjust their hold-
ings at rate 𝜇 > 0. When the price target is 1%higher than a stock’s current
price, investors increase their holdings by 𝜇%over the next year. The stock’s
subsequent price growth also proportionally responds to changes in investors’
demand. Each 1%change in investor demand causes the company’s expected
return to change by 𝜈%over the next year for some 𝜈>0.
Our model suggests a plausible justification for using trailing P/E ratios.
The equilibrium price in our model is mostly backward-looking. There is only
one forward-looking input: analysts’ short-term EPS forecast. It makes sense
for analysts to use a mostly backward-looking pricing rule in a world where
prices themselves are mostly backward-looking. In such a world, PriceTarget =
E[EPS]×TrailingPE can generate forecasts that are correct on average.
It also makes sharp testable predictions. Imagine that immediately after
Chris Horvers published his December 2019 report, he saw something that led
him to believe Home Depot’s earnings would go up by ΔE[EPS]=+$0.05over
the next year and then grow at a Δ𝑔=+1%faster rate thereafter . In our model,
the change in Home Depot’s long-run growth rate would be irrelevant. The
company had been trading at 21.0×, so Chris Horvers’ price target would go up
byΔPriceTarget =$1.05=21.0×$0.05. By contrast, in the Gordon model, the
+1%increase in Home Depot’s long-run growth rate would cause Chris Horvers
to use a larger multiple, leading to an even larger increase in his price target.
Section 3 demonstrates that trailing P/E ratios explain both analysts’ price
targets and realized price changes. We start with analysts’ price targets. Chris
Horvers said he used a trailing P/E ratio to set price targets for Home Depot.
Figure 3 shows that IBES data support this claim.
The red line in the top panel shows Chris Horvers’ most recent PriceTarget𝑡def=
E𝑡[Price𝜏+1]on each trading day 𝑡during the window from 18months to
6months prior to Home Depot’s next fiscal year-end date, (𝜏+1). The red
line in the bottom panel shows the P/E ratio implied by Chris Horvers’ price
target and his earnings forecast for the following fiscal year, ImpliedPE𝑡def=
PriceTarget𝑡/E𝑡[EPS𝜏+2]. This implied P/E closely tracks Home Depot’s trailing
twelve-month (TTM) P/E ratio shown in blue, TrailingPE𝑡def=Price𝑡/EPS𝑡.

Of course, we know that Chris Horvers’ 21.0×trailing P/E in December 2019
was computed over the past three years not just the most recent twelve months.
These sorts of perturbations explain why the fit is not perfect. Nevertheless, the
right panel of Figure 4 shows that our simple trailing twelve-month calculation
is a good first approximation to how most analysts set price targets.
By capturing the essence of what analysts say they are doing, PriceTarget =
E[EPS]×TrailingPE , we are able to explain over 91% of the variation in their
price targets. Our model’s fit is not perfect. But it predicts investors’ subjective
return expectations far better than any other model we know of.
We next turn our attention to how the market responds to earnings surprises.
When a company announces quarterly earnings that deviate from the consensus
forecast, investors often learn important things about a firm that can have long-
term ramifications. The larger the surprise, the more likely this is. In the Gordon
model, a change in the long-run earnings growth rate would cause investors to
price a firm’s expected short-run earnings using a different multiple.

By contrast, our model uses a trailing P/E that is set in stone. Analysts update
their price targets to reflect changes in their short-term earnings forecast. The
company’s share price responds proportionally, ΔPrice ={𝜆·(EPS−E[EPS])}×
TrailingPE for some𝜆 >0. Importantly, our model says that the same value of
𝜆will apply no matter how large or small the earnings surprise was.
We test this prediction using an approach similar to Fama and MacBeth
(1973). First, we group stock-quarter observations by the size of their earnings
surprise,𝑠∈{− $0.30,..., $0.30}. Then, within each bucket, we run a separate
regression to estimate the relationship between a stock’s trailing P/E ratio and
its subsequent price change, ˆ𝜆𝑠. This gives us 60distinct estimates for 𝜆·𝑠, and
we verify that they all imply a very similar value of ˆ𝜆𝑠/𝑠=𝜆.
There is a deep crack in the foundation of asset-pricing theory. Researchers
currently assume that an asset’s price must always reflect some sort of expected
discounted payoff. They spend most of their time trying to understand how an
asset’s expected payoff is being discounted, and analysts’ earnings forecasts
have played a key role in this pursuit. However, when we read what analysts
write in their reports, we find that most of them do not set price targets by
discounting a company’s expected EPS. Instead, they typically use a trailing P/E
ratio. We point to a better way forward by constructing a new kind of model
and showing that it explains key patterns in the data.

Related literature. This paper borrows from and builds on several strands
of related literature. To start with, it is an asset-pricing analog to Ben-David
and Chinco (2024). In that paper, we took managers at their word when they
said they were EPS maximizers and fleshed out the implications for corporate
policies. In this paper, we take sell-side analysts at their word when they say
they use trailing P/E ratios and derive the implications for asset prices.
We are not the first researchers to notice that market participants talk
about short-term cash-flow multiples. There are numerous papers studying
the accuracy of multiples analysis for pricing public equities (Bhojraj and Lee,
2002; Liu et al., 2002; Da and Schaumburg, 2011; Bartram and Grinblatt, 2018;
Cooper and Lambertides, 2023), IPOs (Kim and Ritter, 1999; Purnanandam and
Swaminathan, 2004), and syndicated loan deals (Murfin and Pratt, 2019). We
think these papers are fascinating and deserve far more attention. But we also
think they bury the lede. The fact that analysts use a trailing P/E is inconsistent
with textbook present-value logic. . . no matter how accurate their forecasts are.
Our paper connects to the broader literature on belief formation (Mal-
mendier and Nagel, 2011; Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014; Coibion and Gorod-
nichenko, 2015; Giglio, Maggiori, Stroebel, and Utkus, 2021; Bordalo, Gennaioli,
Ma, and Shleifer, 2020). There is substantial evidence that sell-side analysts
suffer from predictable biases when making earnings forecasts (La Porta, 1996;
So, 2013; Bouchaud, Krueger , Landier , and Thesmar, 2019; Bordalo, Gennaioli,
La Porta, and Shleifer, 2019, 2020, 2024; De la O and Myers, 2021). We would
also like to know how biases in analysts’ subjective earnings forecasts affect
asset prices. But, to answer this question, researchers need to correctly model
how these subjective beliefs get priced.
Last but not least, this paper provides evidence against the discount-rate
approach to asset pricing. Textbook models say that “asset markets are [supposed
to be] in reality big insurance markets (Cochrane, 1999).” These models argue
that a company’s current share price should reflect investors’ desire to insure
themselves against exposure to specific kinds of future aggregate risks. It is
hard to find people who think this way in the real world (Chinco, Hartzmark,
and Sussman, 2022). This paper proposes a simple alternative approach.

1 In Their Own Words
The goal of asset-pricing research is to figure out how market participants
would price any arbitrary set of risky cash flows. However, in the particular
case of sell-side analysts, there is nothing to figure out. For the past two decades,
analysts have been legally required to write down their pricing rule in the text
of each earnings report. In May 2002, the SEC passed NASD Rule 2711 stating
that: “If a research report contains a price target, the [analyst] must disclose in
the research report the valuation methods used to determine the price target.”
In this section, we examine how analysts explain their own pricing rule and
find that most do not compute any sort of expected discounted payoff. Instead,
they typically rely on a trailing P/E ratio.
1.1 Data description
Analysts explicitly state how they price their own subjective cash-flow
expectations in the text of each earnings report. We read these reports and
ask: “How did the author of this report convert their earnings forecast, E𝑡[EPS],
into a price target, PriceTarget𝑡?” Every report has an entire section where the
analyst directly answers this question as shown in Figure 2.
We downloaded 513earnings reports from Investext in two separate waves.
We started with 339reports written about the 30largest publicly traded compa-
nies at year-end in 2004, 2011, and 2019. This gives us 47companies in total
(see Table 1). For each company in a given year , we include one report written
by each brokerage in Table 2.
Based on this first sample, it does not look like sell-side analysts apply present-
value reasoning to price their own subjective cash-flow expectations. However ,
these are run-of-the-mill reports written by average analysts. Perhaps the best
analysts still use forward-looking present-value logic when writing reports that
really matter?
To check whether this is the case, we then downloaded an additional 174
coverage-initiation reports written by 28sell-side analysts who have been

repeatedly named to Institutional Investor magazine’s All-American research
team. These analysts are the best of the best (Stickel, 1992), and coverage-
initiation reports are the ones that really matter . Analysts put a disproportionate
amount of effort into writing them (McNichols and O’Brien, 1997), often laying
out their general theory for pricing the firm. The average coverage-initiation
report in our sample runs 29pages. 20% are40+pages long.
Institutional Investor publishes their rankings in October . We read through
these issues and recorded which analysts made the All-American research team
each year. The magazine ranks analysts by GICS sector. For each sector, we
created a list of the 10analysts with the most years on the All-American team.
The174documents in our second wave are coverage-initiation reports written
by All-American analysts on our top- 10list.
Analysts write coverage-initiation reports either when a company is new
or when they join a new brokerage. 53of our 174coverage-initiation reports
(30.5%of the sample) involve companies that went public within the previous
three years. If anything, analysts should be more likely to use forward-looking
information in this sample because there is less trailing information to go on.
Many firms also start out with negative earnings, making it difficult for analysts
to apply the formula PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE.

This is a meaningful restriction. For example, IBES does not include data on Ed
Hyman, head of Evercore ISI’s economic research team and the single most-
capped analyst on Institutional Investor magazine’s All-American team.
To check the quality of our data, we downloaded all earnings reports in
Investext for a subset of analyst-firm pairs. As you can see from Figure 6, the
price targets and EPS forecasts in the PDFs perfectly match up with the numbers
in IBES. Moreover, the P/E ratios implied by these numbers (red lines; bottom
panel) line up with the P/E ratios that analysts say they are using in their reports.
We do not include the data from these additional reports in our main analysis;
we only use them to ensure the accuracy of our raw numbers.

1.2 Most Analysts Rely On Trailing P/E Ratios
Multiples analysis is the norm. Table 4 shows that analysts used some form
of multiples analysis in 94.5%of our sample ( 485out of 513reports). Price-to-
earnings (P/E) was the most common multiple and was listed in the methods
section 76.8%of the time.
Analysts set a price target based on a multiple of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), cash flows (CF), or sales 43.9%
of the time ( 225 of513 reports). These calculations are delevered versions of
E[EPS]×TrailingPE . Analysts often use E[EBITDA]×TrailingEVtoEBITDA in
situations where a company’s EPS has been negative in recent years. In this
paper , we treat it as a separate method to be as conservative as possible.

Table 4. “Any Multiple”: report used at least one multiple to calculate the price
target. “P/E Ratio”: report used a firm’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (P/E). “EBITDA,
CF, Sales”: report set a price target based on a multiple of EBITDA, cash flow, or
sales. “Book Value”: report used a multiple of the book value of a firm’s assets.
“P/E-to-Growth”: report used the ratio of a company’s P/E to its EPS growth rate.
“Dividend Yield”: report used a firm’s dividend yield when setting a price target. Top
number in each cell is the percent relative to the total for the column. e.g., 78of91
reports in 2004 described using some form of multiples analysis, 78/91=85.7%.
Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with multiples analysis. The issue
is the way that analysts calculate their multiple. Sell-side analysts typically
choose their multiple based on where the firm and others like it have been
trading at in recent years. Table 5 shows that analysts set a price target by
looking at a firm’s own trailing multiple in 63.5%of our sample ( 326 of513
reports). They looked at the recent pricing of the firm’s peer group in 74.1%of
our sample ( 380 reports), and they made both kinds of comparisons in over
half of the reports in our sample ( 260out of 513reports; 50.7%).
The popularity of peer-group comparisons in our data is driven by the fact
that coverage-initiation reports make up a third of our sample ( 174 of513
reports; 33.9%). As noted earlier , many of these firms recently went public. In
these cases, there is often not enough trailing data to compute an average.

There is every reason to believe that analysts are capable of calculating
a forward-looking multiple. They regularly perform calculations that are far
more involved than E[EPS]× 1
𝑟−𝑔
. Table 6 shows that they performed “sum
of the parts (SOTP)” analysis in 9.6%of our sample ( 49of513 reports). For
example, Figure 7 shows an October 2019 earnings report about Amazon from
Wolfe Research. The analyst who wrote this report, Chris Bottiglieri, used a
different multiple to value each line of Amazon’s business.
Likewise, analysts use multiple multiples in 38.8%of our sample ( 199of513
reports). For example, Figure 8 shows an April 2010 coverage-initiation report
about Avis Budget written by an All-American analyst, Himanshu Patel. It is
a thorough report by a high-quality analyst, and the price target has nothing
to do with expected discounted payoff. Himanshu Patel uses a combination of
backward-looking multiples.
Sell-side analysts have played a critical role in the asset-pricing literature,
and “price equals expected discounted payoff” is the bedrock of every asset-
pricing model. It is problematic that this particular group of market participants
typically does not discount their own expected payoffs.

e.g., 28of91reports in 2004 described using multiple multiples, 28/91=30.8%.
1.3 Price Seldom Equals Expected Discounted Payoff
Table 7 shows that sell-side analysts mention a discounted cash-flow (DCF)
or dividend discount model in just 30.2%of reports ( 155of513). What’s more,
this statistic includes any report that mentions the terms “DCF” or “Discounted
Cash Flow” in the methods section. Green, Hand, and Zhang (2016) notes that, in
roughly 91% of reports that use these keywords, “there is no recognizable DCF
model provided in the report itself.” Many reports that talk about DCF modeling
do so using boilerplate language without providing any specifics.
What’s more, analysts rarely use a discount model in isolation ( 5.5%of the
time; just 28reports). 19of these 28discount-model-only reports were written
by three analysts at Credit Suisse. In many ways, the 19DCF-only reports are
the worst pieces of research in our sample. The methods section in Figure 9
is not even a complete sentence. When we compare with Table 6, we see that
analysts were more likely to use multiple multiples ( 38.8%of reports) than to
use any sort of discounting model ( 30.2%of reports).
Prior to examining the data, we anticipated that analysts would be more
likely to use a DCF model in coverage-initiation reports. After all, many of the 174
reports in our sample were written about newly public firms with little historical
data. However , the “All Am” column in Table 7 shows that DCF analysis is even

less common in this subset of our data. Only one in five coverage-initiation
reports make use of a discount model in any capacity ( 34of174reports; 19.5%).
The All-American analysts who are responsible for these reports often talk
about DCF models as a second-best option. For example, Figure 10 shows a
coverage-initiation report about Pacific Biosciences (PACB) from December
2010. In the methods section of his report, the lead analyst explains that while
“multiple-based valuations (e.g., P/E and EV/EBITDA) are common in the life sci-
ence tools industry,” he has “chosen to use a DCF methodology” out of necessity.

“PACB is unprofitable (and yet lacks revenue).” Sell-side analysts are perfectly
capable of doing these calculations. But they typically choose not to.
What’s more, when analysts do use a discount model, they often implement
it in a way that is inconsistent with present-value reasoning. They place no
special emphasis on the forward-looking nature of the DCF model. They think
about 1
𝑟−𝑔
as just another trailing multiple (Mukhlynina and Nyborg, 2020).
Table 7 indicates that analysts blend together the price targets implied by a DCF
model and a trailing multiple in 24.6%of our sample ( 126reports).
In most of these reports, the analyst literally just takes the average. For
example, Figure 11 shows a December 2019 report about Citigroup where
the lead analyst, Mike Mayo, describes computing the “simple average of six
valuation techniques (PE, price-to-book, dividend discount model, PE/G ratio
analysis and sum of the parts for both PE and PB).”

the stock market. And, when valuing this group of firms, we find that sell-side
analysts do not typically set price equal to expected discounted payoff.
However , analysts do regularly use DCF models in specific niche industries.
Present-value logic is the norm when analysts value shipping companies, which
are set up as master limited partnerships (MLPs) for tax reasons. DCF is also
used to price real-estate investment trusts (REITs) and resource-extraction
companies (oil, gas, mining, etc).
It is obvious when a report uses present-value reasoning. Figure 12 shows
a coverage-initiation report written by Michael Webber about GasLog Ltd in
January 2014. Michael Webber clearly states that he is using a DCF model. He
gives us the precise numerical inputs needed to do the calculation. Asset-pricing
researchers assume that every earnings report looks like this. Outside of a few
special situations, most do not.

1.5 Expected Returns Do Not Reflect (Exotic) Risks
Asset-pricing textbooks argue that an asset’s expected return is determined
by how its payoffs are distributed across good and bad future states of the world.
The logic follows from a state-contingent generalization of Equation (1)
Price𝑡=E𝑡Dividend 𝑠,𝑡+1+Price𝑠,𝑡+1

(5b)
The realized value of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) in state 𝑠,𝑚𝑠def= 1
1+𝑟𝑠
,
reflects the current price of an asset that would pay $1next year in that state.
To keep things simple, suppose there are only two states, 𝑠∈{good,bad}.
In this framework, investors would be willing to pay $1·𝑚bad= $1
1+𝑟bad
today
to receive $1next year in the bad state. Researchers assume that $1·𝑚bad= $1
1+𝑟bad> $1
1+𝑟good=$1·𝑚good since that is when they will really need the
money. When an asset’s expected returns are unusually low, researchers figure

19th 2019 by Wells Fargo. The lead analyst on this report was Mike Mayo.
that most of its future payoffs must arrive in some sort of bad state of the world
that investors do not discount very much. The only question is which one?
On one hand, our results are consistent with Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta,
and Shleifer (2024), which argues that differences in expected returns are not
compensation for bearing exotic state-contingent risks. None of the 513earnings
reports in our sample described anything remotely similar to the above logic.
We do not expect market participants to use terms like “stochastic discount
factor”, but investors must be able to formulate certain basic ideas for the SDF
approach to work. Investors can buy a stock that offers insurance against bad
times without knowing it. But textbook models predict that this stock will have
low expected returns because investors bid up its current price on account of
this insurance value. Investors cannot do this by accident.
But, on the other hand, we also find very little evidence that expected re-
turns are compensation for simple risk either . Instead, sell-side analysts often
say that their next-twelve-month return forecast is derived from their beliefs
about a company’s short-term earnings growth rate. For example, Figure 13
shows a coverage-initiation report written by Brian Tunick about Chico’s FAS
in May 2015. At the top of the first page, he predicts “mid-to high-teens total
returns...comprised of 15% EPS CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from
2015–2017E and a ∼2%dividend yield”.

26
This is precisely what we would expect from an analyst who thought about
a company’s price mainly in terms of trailing P/E ratios. Suppose an analyst
calculates his price targets, E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡, using a
trailing twelve-month P/E, TrailingPE𝑡=Price𝑡/EPS𝑡. In that case, we could
rewrite his one-year-ahead return forecasts as
E𝑡[Return𝑡+1]=E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡
Price𝑡
+E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]
Price𝑡(6a)
=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]× Price𝑡
EPS𝑡−Price𝑡
Price𝑡
+E𝑡[DivYield 𝑡+1] (6b)
=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]
EPS𝑡−1
+E𝑡[DivYield 𝑡+1] (6c)
This is extremely similar to the way that Brian Tunick made his return forecast
for Chico’s FAS. The main difference is that his “ ∼2%dividend yield” was a
trailing average rather than an expected value. More on this shortly.
1.6 Subjective Expectations Do Not Respect Identities
Asset-pricing researchers assume that Brian Tunick’s price target for Chico’s
FAS (CHS) came from asking: “How much are the rights to CHS’s expected future
earnings worth in today’s dollars?” Instead, he thought to himself: “If right
now a company reported the earnings I expect CHS to generate in two years,
how would this comparable firm be priced given recent multiples?” Given his
approach, there is no reason why Brian Tunick’s price target would respect
forward-looking accounting identities.
Researchers think it is completely natural to replace the Price𝑡+1on the
right-hand side of Equation (1)withE𝑡+1[Dividend 𝑡+2]+E𝑡+1[Price𝑡+2]
1+𝑟and then swap
out the Price𝑡+2in the resulting expression withE𝑡+2[Dividend 𝑡+3]+E𝑡+2[Price𝑡+3]
1+𝑟and
so on. . . This is where the dividend discount model in Equation (3)comes from.
But, if analysts do not set price equal to expected discounted payoff, there is no
reason for them to enforce consistency between an asset’s current price and
the discounted value of their price target.
27
Asset-pricing researchers often try to understand the asset-pricing implica-
tions of biased subjective beliefs by plugging analyst earnings forecasts from
IBES into Campbell and Shiller (1988)’s log-linear approximation for 1

(7)
In his own textbook, John Campbell explains how Equation (7)should “hold ex
ante, not only for rational expectations but also for irrational expectations that
respect identities. (Campbell, 2017)” If sell-side analysts’ price targets do not
respect identities, it is not clear what we learn from this exercise.
Notice the tension between Andrea Teixeira’s trading recommendation in
Figure 14 and her backward-looking multiple. She gave Pepsi an “Overweight”
rating, meaning that “[she] expected [the company to] outperform the average
total return of the other stocks in [her] coverage universe. (JP Morgan, 2019b)”
Yet, even though Ms Teixeira thought Pepsi’s past price was too low, she still
used a backward-looking 24×P/E ratio to create her price target.
The numbers in earnings reports often do not mean what researchers think
they mean. In many cases, they are computed in a way that suggests the analysis
must be approaching the problem differently. For example, Figure 14(c) shows
a table of key metrics from an October 2019 earnings report written by Andrea
Teixeira about Pepsi. The row highlighted in blue shows Pepsi’s share price in
October 2019, Price Oct‘19=$138.23, divided by its EPS in a given year

This is exactly the sort of P/E ratio one would expect from someone who is
thinking about how a company’s future earnings would be priced under current

market conditions. No researcher would report these numbers as coming from
the same variable in an academic paper . You probably would never even think
to perform this calculation. And we think this is one reason why researchers
have previously overlooked this glaring piece of evidence.
Skeptical? Let’s run an experiment. Go back to page 3 in the introduction. In
Figure 2, Chris Horvers calculated the P/E ratios in his valuation matrix just
like Andrea Teixeira. Did you notice? Home Depot’s closing price on December

to look for this calculation prior to writing this paper . Our guess is that, before
reading our paper , the thought had not crossed your mind either .
1.7 Analysts Price Expected EPS Not Expected Payoffs
Asset-pricing textbooks assume that analysts care about earnings because
these cash flows allow a firm to pay dividends. Given this prediction, it is
noteworthy how few of the earnings reports discuss a company’s dividend
payout rate. Table 4 shows that analysts mention a company’s dividend yield in
just6.4%of all reports ( 33of513).
While most analysts do not use any sort of present-value model, those that
do tend to compute the present discounted value of a company’s cash flows not
its dividend payouts to shareholders. Outside of a few special cases, analysts
consistently ignore a company’s plowback rate. Suppose that two firms have the
same future earnings stream, but one pays out a much larger dividend. Most
analysts would assign both firms the same price target. The December 2019
Wells Fargo report about Citigroup in Figure 11 is one of the few reports that
specifically talks about using a dividend discount model.
When analysts do mention a company’s dividend yield, they typically only
use it to compute their return forecast. Dividends rarely play a role in setting
price targets. In short, analysts “track capital gains and dividends as separate
and largely independent variables. (Hartzmark and Solomon, 2019)”

Figure 15. Earning report about Chevron Corp, which was published on November
1st 2011 by Argus Research. The lead analyst on this report was Philip Weiss.
Figure 15 shows a November 2011 report about Chevron Corp written
by Philip Weiss. In the methods section of his report, Mr Weiss says that he
considered both trailing multiples analysis as well as a DCF model when setting
PriceTarget𝑡=$130 , which was 24% higher than Chevron’s current price,
$105.05. But he did not make any reference to Chevron’s dividend yield when
justifying his price target.
Chevron’s dividend yield only showed up when Mr Weiss made his “buy”
recommendation. Chevron had paid a dividend of $3.12per share to each
shareholder in 2011. Mr Weiss argued that an investor should expect Chevron’s
returns to reflect both the 24% capital gain implied by his price target as well
as the company’s trailing-twelve-month dividend yield,$3.12

It might at first seem like Mr Weiss was following textbook logic, but the
nature of these two differences shows that he was not. A company’s expected
return should be equal to its expected capital gain plus its expected dividend
yield, E𝑡[Return𝑡+1]=
E𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡

E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1]

, but this is not what Mr
Weiss calculated in Equation (8). His price target was based on trailing multiples,
and he used Chevron’s trailing twelve-month (TTM) dividend yield rather than
its expected dividend yield next year , Dividend 𝑡≠E𝑡[Dividend 𝑡+1].
Mr Weiss did not just deviate from textbook logic. He did the precise opposite.
On the first page of his report, he predicts that Chevron’s dividend yield will
grow 8.80% over the next twelve months. Yet he still used a trailing dividend
yield to calculate a 27% expected return. That is not a mistake. It is a choice.
1.8 Do Analysts Give Credible Descriptions?
We have talked to a number of sell-side analysts. Based on these conver-
sations, our general sense is that the methods section contains a brief honest
account of how they actually compute their price targets. Researchers are
clearly comfortable using analysts’ numerical forecast values. If these numbers
represent a credible data source, we see no reason to discard the data about
how analysts calculated them. Why should “ 4” be any more worthy of study
than “two times two”?
Moreover, even if an analyst does not put in much effort when writing
the methods section of their report, this fact should not push them towards
descriptions of tailing P/E ratios rather than discounted cash flows. It is just as
easy to give a brief account of either approach. Many DCF-only reports have a
one-line methods section (see Figure 9).
It is true that analysts are more likely to include a price target in an earnings
report when they are optimistic about a company’s future prospects (Brav and
Lehavy, 2003). However , while this fact introduces an upward bias into analysts’
price targets, it has no implications for the way that analysts describe their
approach. It is just as easy to plug a small 𝑟into 1
𝑟−𝑔
as it is to cherry-pick a
favorable trailing window when calculating a P/E.
32
Unlike an active investor with a profitable trading rule, a sell-side analyst
has no incentive to hide their pricing rule. If anything, their incentives point in
the opposite direction. Sell-side analysts are in the business of writing research
articles that advertise how thoroughly they understand a company’s fundamen-
tals and future prospects. Misleading their readership about which pricing rule
they are using does not help them accomplish this goal.
1.9 Is Our Data Sample Representative?
A recent working paper , Décaire and Graham (2024), analyzes a much larger
data set and finds a similar point estimate. This paper uses machine-learning
techniques to analyze the discount rates reported in a collection of 78.5k earn-
ings reports. When describing their sample, the authors acknowledge that only
“40% of all reports available on Refinitiv since 2009” include a DCF model. Thus,
the78.5k earnings reports in that study are analogous to the subset of 155
reports in our sample where the analyst talks about using a DCF model in some
capacity. This is a highly non-representative sample.
Another recent working paper , Gormsen and Huber (2024), employed a team
of research assistants to analyze what managers said to sell-side analysts in 74k
quarterly earnings conference calls. Just like before, the authors find that most
conference calls do not make any reference to present-value logic. Select $1at
random from the total value of the US stock market. There is a greater than 60%
chance that this $1came from a firm that has never mentioned a discount rate
inanyconference call over the past two decades. The same ballpark 40% value
shows up again. These papers show how infrequently DCF models are used.
1.10 Do Other Investors Think Like Analysts?
There are good reasons to believe that sell-side analysts are not the only ones
using trailing P/Es. Again, it is called sell-side research for a reason. Presumably
there are other investors interested in buying this research output. Sell-side
analysts have been around in something resembling their current form since

Apple was founded in 1976. Given how long the company has lasted, it would
be odd if no one had ever seen someone using a MacBook.
We also examine price calculations in seven different kinds of SEC regulatory
filings from January 2001 through November 2023: (1) 8-K; a public company
must submit one of these “current report” forms any time a major event takes
place. (2) SC 13E3; a public company must file this form when going private.
(3) SC TO-T; a public company must file this form when it makes a tender
offer for another company’s shares as part of a takeover bid. (4) SC 14D9; the
target of this takeover bid must file its response to the tender offer using this
form. (5) SC 13D; an investor must file this “beneficial ownership” form within
10days of acquiring ownership of ≥5%of a company’s stock. (6) SC 13G;
this is an abbreviated version of form SC 13D, which is often used by large
passive investors. (7) NPORT-P; 1940-Act funds use this form to report holdings,
performance, assets under management, etc on a quarterly basis.

The last row of Table 8 shows that only 19.0%of all valuation-related forms
in our sample included any of the following terms: “DCF”, “discounted cash”,
“beta”, “WACC”, or “present value”. By contrast, we find that 92.9%of these
forms included the term “multiples” or “comparables”.
8-K filings make up 628k/698k=90% of all valuation-related filings in our
sample. So you might worry our results are being skewed by this one particular
kind of form. But the second-to-last row of Table 8 should allay this concern.
When we look at the remaining 70k observations, only 34.0%mention any sort
of discount model while 90.6%talk about multiples analysis.
1.11 Where Do Researchers Go From Here?
Suppose that, for the sake of argument, sell-side analysts were the only ones
using trailing P/E ratios. Even if all other investors set price equal to expected
discounted payoff, researchers do not get to observe these other investors’
subjective beliefs. Much of what researchers think they know about discount
rates comes from studying analysts’ earnings forecasts. Our findings show that,
for the most part, analysts do not use one.
Sell-side analysts describe their price-forecasting problem in an entirely
different way than an academic researcher would. The day-to-day business
of being an asset-pricing theorist involves writing down models of expected
returns. They assume that investors use the model-implied expected return as
their discount rate when setting price levels.
Of the 155reports in our sample that mentioned a DCF or dividend discount
model, the majority never specify which discount rate was used. Philip Weiss
said he used a DCF model to set a price target for Chevron in his November
2011 report. This document contained nearly 200exact numerical values. For
each trailing multiple he listed in Figure 15(b), Mr Weiss gave both the precise
value as well as its historical range. However , at no point in his report did Philip
Weiss bother to say which discount rate he used to calculate 1
𝑟−𝑔
.
With𝑁≥3observations, it is always possible to estimate a cross-sectional
regression,𝑌𝑛∼ˆ𝛼+ˆ𝛽·𝑋𝑛+𝜖𝑛. But every researcher recognizes that ˆ𝛽≠0does not
35
imply a causal relationship between 𝑋and𝑌. Likewise, there is nothing stopping
a researcher from estimating the best-fit discount rate implied by analysts’
earnings forecast and a company’s current share price. But the existence of this
fitted value does not imply that analysts are using it to set target prices or form
expectations. It is clear from reading analysts’ reports that they are not. This is
not a solid enough foundation to build our entire field around.
Researchers have found that analyst-implied discount rates are consistent
with the intertemporal capital asset-pricing model (ICAPM; Pástor, Sinha, and
Swaminathan, 2008), international asset-pricing models (Lee, Ng, and Swami-
nathan, 2009), and the pricing of default risk (Chava and Purnanandam, 2010).
But if analysts are not actually using these implied discount rates to price assets,
where is the close empirical fit coming from? It is possible to accidentally buy
insurance against a future risk, but investors cannot accidentally assign the
correct price to this insurance (Chinco, Hartzmark, and Sussman, 2022).
It is hard to escape the conclusion that researchers are modeling a problem
that does not matter to sell-side analysts in the real world. Textbook models
say that investors equate a company’s share price with its expected discounted
payoff to each shareholder . Financial economists think about the discount rate
embedded in this pricing rule as the most important part of the problem. By
contrast, the analysts in our sample focus all their attention on predicting a
company’s earnings. They pick a recent P/E almost as an afterthought.
While the behavioral-finance literature has spent most of its time looking
for biases in analysts’ EPS forecasts, at least analysts are trying hard to get those
numbers right. In contrast, they are not even trying to calculate the expected
discounted payoff at the heart of every standard asset-pricing model. This seems
like the bigger issue.
We appreciate that every profession does some things on autopilot. For ex-
ample, financial economists often cluster their standard errors without thinking
too carefully about how they do it (Petersen, 2008). The surprising thing is that
analysts so pay little attention to the thing (the “P” in the P/E ratio) asset-pricing
researchers obsess over . That is noteworthy.
36
2 A Simple Model
We have just seen that, in addition to telling us their subjective earnings
forecasts, sell-side analysts also tell us how they price them. They do not set
“price equal to expected discounted payoff”. Our hope is that, the next time you
sit down to write an asset-pricing model, you will consider building this model
on some other “simple concept”. In this section, we provide an example of what
such a model might look like.
In Subsection 2.1, we start by outlining how a company’s earnings change
over time. Then, in Subsection 2.2, we take analysts at their word when they
describe using a firm’s trailing P/E ratio to set price targets. We model investors
who proportionally adjust their holdings of a firm after looking at the relative
difference between analysts’ price target and the company’s current price.
In Subsection 2.3, we characterize the resulting asset prices. We show that
it is possible for PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE to be correct on average
because prices themselves are mostly backward-looking. Finally, in Subsection
2.4, we highlight how our model implies a strong exclusion restriction. For a
piece of news to affect a company’s expected return, it must change analysts’
short-term earnings expectations.
2.1 Earnings Growth
In textbook models, investors care about earnings only insofar as these
earnings translate into future payouts. However , as noted in the previous section,
sell-side analysts price earnings for earnings’ sake. So we put earnings per share
(EPS) at the center of our model. Study a single company with earnings over the
past twelve months, EPS 𝑡, that are governed by the following law of motion

EPS𝑡+1−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
=𝑋𝑡+𝜖𝑡+1 (9)
𝑋𝑡≈E𝑡[ΔlogEPS𝑡+1]is the expected rate at which the company’s earnings will
grow over the next year , and 𝜖𝑡+1IID∼Normal(0,𝜎2)is a noise term.
37
Think about a firm that had earnings of EPS𝑡=$1.00per share over the past
year . Over the next twelve months, its earnings are expected to grow by 𝑋𝑡=5%
on average. But investors would not be surprised to see the firm’s earnings
growth rate by 𝜎=2%pt higher or lower. Given these assumptions, investors
expect the company to generate earnings of E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]=$1.05±$0.02for each
shareholder over the next year and E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]=$1.11±$0.04the year after .
If we were writing down a traditional asset-pricing model, then the com-
pany’s current share price would be determined by the expected discounted
value of its entire future cash-flow stream. In that sort of model, it would be
important for us to explain how 𝑋𝑡evolves over time as well. But we are not
writing down that sort of model. All that matters is short-term earnings growth,
so we have deliberately chosen not to specify the longer-term dynamics.
2.2 Investor Demand
LetPrice𝑡denote the company’s current price level. At each time 𝑡, the
analysts in our model set a one-year-ahead price target
PriceTarget𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡 (10)
For simplicity, we will assume analysts calculate the firm’s trailing P/E ratio
using the past twelve months of data, TrailingPE𝑡def=Price𝑡/EPS𝑡.
In standard asset-pricing models, investors make portfolio decisions to
maximize their expected utility. However , sell-side analysts make explicit trading
recommendations by comparing their price target to a company’s current price.
For example, in an October 2019 report, Kaumil Gajrawala describes how he
“[rated] PepsiCo underperform based on its expected return relative to our target
price. (Credit Suisse, 2019)” And analysts’ recommendations can be worth acting
on (Birru, Gokkaya, Liu, and Stulz, 2022).
In our model, investors compare analysts’ price target to the company’s
current price. When the price target is higher,PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡
Price𝑡>0%, they tell
their broker to buy shares over the next year. When the price target is lower,
38
PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡
Price𝑡<0%, they tell their broker to reduce their position over the
upcoming twelve months. Moreover , in both scenarios, investors will send their
broker instructions to buy in proportion to the relative price difference

Demand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡
Demand 𝑡
=𝜇·PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡
Price𝑡
(11)
𝜇 > 0is a positive constant, which is known as a demand “multiplier”.
To make things concrete, suppose that the company is currently trading at
Price𝑡=$100 and the demand multiplier is 𝜇=1. If analysts set a one-year-
ahead price target of PriceTarget𝑡=$103 , then investors would respond by
increasing their holdings 1· $103−$100
$100=3%over the next year. If investors
currently hold Demand 𝑡=300,000shares. Then, a year from now, they would
like to own Demand 𝑡+1=309,000shares in this example.
We saw in the previous section that, sell-side analysts spend most of their
time fine-tuning their near-term earnings forecast. Then, when it comes time to
capitalize these expected earnings into a price target, they use a trailing P/E. In
other words, real-world analysts set price targets by asking themselves: “What
would the firm’s price be at current multiples if it had realized earnings of
E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]rather than EPS𝑡today?” In our model, investors adjust their holdings
based on the thing analysts actually care about.
Proposition 2.2 (Demand Schedule) .If analysts use trailing P/E ratios to set
price targets (Equation 10) and investors proportionally adjust their holdings
over the next year in response (Equation 11), then changes in investors’ demand
will reflect changes in expected short-term earnings growth

Demand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡
Demand 𝑡
=𝜇·E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
(12)
“Asset-pricing theory all stems from one simple concept: price equals ex-
pected discounted payoff. The rest is elaboration, special cases, and a closet full
of tricks. (Cochrane, 2009, page 1)” Researchers are so used to thinking this way
that many assume it is the only way—i.e., that investor demand must ultimately
be derived from expected discounted payoffs. But it is not so.
39
2.3 Asset Prices
Obviously, in a world where sell-side analysts do apply present-value logic,
there is no reason to expect their price targets to line up with the present
discounted value of a firm’s expected dividend stream. But this does not imply
that their forecasts are wrong. If realized prices do not reflect present-value
logic either , then analysts’ price targets might still be roughly correct.
We now point to a simple assumption about how prices evolve over time
that leads to exactly this sort of scenario. Specifically, we assume that there
exists a strictly positive constant, 𝜈>0, such that

Price𝑡+1−Price𝑡
Price𝑡
=𝜈·
Demand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡
Demand 𝑡
+𝜀𝑡+1 (13)
This assumption says that if investors tell their broker to increase their positions
by1%over the upcoming year , then the company’s share price with increase by
𝜈%on average. The noise term 𝜀𝑡+1IID∼Normal(0,𝜍2)captures all other reasons
why a company’s share price might increase or decrease next year . Under this
assumption, it is possible for analysts’ price targets to be accurate in a world
where price does not equal expected discounted payoff.
Proposition 2.3 (Correct On Average) .Suppose that investors choose their
demand according to Equation (11) and that realized price growth is governed by
the law of motion in Equation (13). If𝜈=1/𝜇, then
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡 (14)
where ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]is the average price next year observed by an econometrician.
This result follows a long tradition in theoretical asset pricing: guess that the
price function is linear and then verify that the implications are consistent with
some goal. For example, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) guessed that a risky asset’s
price would be a linear function of a signal about the asset’s future payout and
an aggregate supply shock, Price =𝐴+𝐵·Signal−𝐶·Shock . The authors figured
out what this price function “implied for risky asset demand, substituted that
40
demand function into the market-clearing condition, and matched coefficients
to verify their [initial] hypothesis (Veldkamp, 2011)” about the price function
being linear . We are doing something similar . But, instead of guessing that prices
are linear , we match coefficients to verify that price growth is linear .
Analysts say that they set price targets by multiplying a company’s expected
EPS times a trailing P/E as shown in Equation (10). They also explain how their
trading recommendations come from comparing a company’s price target for
next year to its current price level as shown in Equation (11). Given these two
starting points, it is not surprising that there exists some price path under which
it makes sense to use trailing P/E ratios.
The surprising thing is that the price path in Equation (13) is so simple.
The functional forms used by Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) were dictated by
theoretical considerations. They chose to study a CARA-normal setting because,
in that sort of model, it would be natural to expect prices to be linear . By contrast,
the functional forms in our model are dictated by what real-world market
participants say. Nevertheless, we are still able to outline a simple scenario in
which PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE is correct on average.
It is also noteworthy that the law of motion for prices (Equation 13) involves
the same sort of proportional thinking found in investors’ demand rule (Equa-
tion 11). It makes sense to use E[EPS]×TrailingPE when investors’ demand
and price growth both respond proportionally.
This connects our work to the literature on demand-system asset pricing
(Koijen and Yogo, 2019; Gabaix and Koijen, 2024). Equations (11) and (13) are
written down in percentage changes, so 𝜇and𝜈can be seen as a demand
multiplier and a price elasticity. Under this interpretation, it would be natural
to expect𝜇=1/𝜈as required by Proposition 2.3.
That being same, our model focuses on demand multipliers and price elas-
ticities for a very different reason. The demand-system framework cares about
𝜇and𝜈because they play a pivotal role in models where investors solve a
forward-looking portfolio problem and appreciate the implications of market
clearing. By contrast, our model does not enforce market clearing. 𝜇and𝜈
emerge from taking seriously how analysts describe their pricing rule.
41
2.4 Exclusion Restriction
Present-value relationships are valuable because they rule out lots of pos-
sible mechanisms. Let News𝑡be a piece of information revealed about a firm
at time𝑡. If this is how the world works, then News𝑡can only predict the com-
pany’s future returns if it is correlated with changes in investors’ cash-flow
expectations or their discount rate. All price effects must operate through these
two specific channels.
“In general, the claim that an instrument operates through a single known
channel is called an exclusion restriction . (Angrist and Pischke, 2009)” Our
framework implies its own very different kind of exclusion restriction: if News𝑡
predicts the company’s future return, then it must be correlated with the firm’s
near-term expected earnings growth. It does not help to be correlated with
other future outcomes that would matter in textbook models.
Proposition 2.4 (Exclusion Restriction) .IfNews𝑡is uncorrelated with expected
short-run earnings growth, Corr(𝑋𝑡,News𝑡)=0, it will not predict average returns
Corr 
Return𝑡+1,News𝑡=0 (15)
This is true even if News𝑡is correlated with expected earnings growth at some
point farther in the future, Corr(𝑋𝑡+ℎ,News𝑡)≠0forℎ≥1, or the discount rate
that a forward-looking present-value investor would use, Corr(𝑟𝑡+ℎ,News𝑡)≠0.
Researchers typically focus on things that *should* affect prices. An asset-
pricing model’s key predictions usually come from digging into the economic
forces that determine the key parameters. Think about Grossman and Stiglitz
(1980). The main predictions in that paper came from understanding the coeffi-
cient𝐵in the pricing rule Price =𝐴+𝐵·Signal−𝐶·Shock . The authors showed
that, if more investors were to buy the private signal and become informed, the
𝐵coefficient would get larger , resulting in a negative feedback loop.
By contrast, the interesting thing about our model is all the things that
*should not* affect prices. News cannot change the past. The firm’s trailing P/E
ratio is what it is. The only way a piece of news can alter investors’ demand (and

thus the equilibrium price) in our model is by changing the one forward-looking
component: expected earnings growth over the next two years.
Do analysts really ignore information about a company’s earnings three
years from now? Yes. Figure 16 shows a May 2010 coverage-initiation report
about AT&T written by Walter Piecyk, which describes this exact reasoning.
Walter Piecyk recognizes that AT&T’s earnings will plummet in three years when
the company loses its exclusive contract for iPhones. So he concludes: “But that’s
just it. The EPS disaster we foretell is in 2012. . . [making it] fairly challenging to
construct a valuation target that would generate enough downside to merit a
Sell rating.” AT&T’s fiscal year 2012 was two years after Mr Piecyk’s target date
at the time he wrote his report in May 2010—i.e., (𝑡+3)in model time.

3 Explanatory Power
In this section, we show that trailing P/E ratios have a substantial amount of
explanatory power . We describe our data in Subsection 3.1. Then, in Subsection
3.2 we document how PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE can explain over 91%
of the variation in analysts’ price targets. In Subsection 3.3 we show that this
simple formula also explains how market prices respond to earnings surprises.
3.1 Data description
We use data from IBES and the merged CRSP/Compustat daily file. We restrict
our sample to common stocks (share codes 10and 11) traded on NYES, Nasdaq,
or AmEx during the period from 2003 to 2022. For the reasons discussed above,
we exclude firms in the following six Fama-French industries: real estate, coal,
steel, mines, oil, and gold.
Analysts set price targets for a company at the end of the upcoming fiscal year .
We refer to this future date as the “target date” and denote it with (𝜏+1). For
example, Chris Horvers wrote a report in December 2019 that set a price target
of$241 for Home Depot in December 2020 (target date). We distinguish between
trading days 𝑡and target dates 𝜏because an analyst can revise his/her forecast
for the same target date on successive trading days. For each analyst 𝑎tracking
a particular firm 𝑛, we record their most recent price target, PriceTarget𝑎
𝑛,𝑡=
E𝑎
𝑡[Price𝑛,𝜏+1], from 18months to 6months prior to each target date (𝜏+1).
We write the analyst’s corresponding EPS forecast as E𝑎
𝑡[EPS𝑛]. We use the
two-year-ahead EPS forecast when available in IBES, E𝑎
𝑡[EPS𝑛,𝜏+2], otherwise we
use the one-year-ahead value, E𝑎
𝑡[EPS𝑛,𝜏+1]. We restrict our sample to include
observations with a positive EPS forecast, E𝑎
𝑡[EPS𝑛]≥$0.01. We also require
firms to have a price target greater than $1and less than $10,000.
The resulting panel data set is organized by firm ×analyst×target date.
Figures 3 and 6 show what this panel looks like Chris Horvers’ coverage of Home
Depot and Andrea Teixeira’s coverage of Coca-Cola (KO). Figures B1(a)-B1(n) in
Appendix B provide additional examples.

would find that ImpliedPE𝑎

Figure 17 shows the distribution of both ImpliedPE𝑎
𝑛,𝑡and TrailingPE𝑛,𝑡
across firms. We restrict our sample to only include observations where both
these P/E ratios are between 5×and 50×. This sample restriction is motivated
by practical considerations. Market participants see P/E ratios outside of this
range as extreme. In such situations, analysts usually apply an alternative valu-
ation method, such as EV/EBITDA . However, we show in Appendix B Figures
B2(a)-B2(e) that our findings extend outside this range.

3.2 Analysts’ Price Targets

the data without requiring additional fine-tuning. Columns (2)-(4) in Table 10
show that firm, analyst, and month fixed-effects do not add much.
We have found that binned scatterplots do a much better job of conveying
the tight fit between theory and data. Asset-pricing researchers are used to
seeing𝑅2s in the low single digits (Campbell and Thompson, 2008; Welch and
Goyal, 2008). Many have a hard time appreciating what 𝑅2=91.0%really means.
At the very least, we know of two asset-pricing researchers whose first instinct
was to ask questions about the remaining 9%our story does not explain.
The left panel of Figure 18 depicts the relationship between the P/E ratio
implied by an analyst’s price target and EPS forecast ( ImpliedPE𝑎

a company’s trailing twelve-month P/E ratio ( TrailingPE𝑛,𝑡;𝑥-axis). If sell-side
analysts set price targets using nothing but PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE ,
then all the dots should sit up on the 45◦line. The empirical best-fit line is a bit
flatter , but there is no mistaking that it is a line. This is what it looks like when a
simple linear model explains most of the observed variation in the data.

If sell-side analysts were exclusively using PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE
to set price targets, then we should estimate a coefficient of 𝜃=1. Instead, in
column (1) we estimate a value of ˆ𝜃=0.58(±0.01)with an adjusted 𝑅2=54.5%.
In other words, the best-fit line may be a bitter flatter than predicted, but it still
explains more than half of the variation in implied P/E ratios.
Why is the fit not perfect? We can think of a few reasons. First, analysts are
not automatons. When they think other information might be relevant, they

elaborate on PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE . They treat this simple formula
as a starting point, and they tend to add ingredients when a company’s trailing
P/E is extreme in either direction.
Second, analysts often set price targets based on round P/E ratios. Notice all
the spikes in the left panel of Figure 17, showing the cross-sectional distribution
ofImpliedPE𝑎
𝑛,𝑡. When a company’s current price is 19.9×its earnings over the
past twelve months, an analyst will likely use a 20×trailing P/E.
Third, not every analyst calculates a firm’s trailing P/E in the same way.
The TrailingPE𝑛,𝑡variable in our regressions corresponds to the firm’s P/E ratio
over the past twelve months. But some analysts use a longer trailing window.
For example, we saw in Figure 2 that Chris Horvers used a three-year trailing
average P/E to set his price target for Home Depot in October 2019.
We can see from Figure 19 that the most recent four quarters of EPS real-
izations have the largest effect on an analyst’s implied P/E ratio. But there are
also significant coefficients at longer lags as well. We are able to explain 91% of
the variation in analysts’ price targets even before incorporating the effects of
longer-term lags.

3.3 Realized Price Changes
In the final part of our empirical analysis, we show that trailing P/E ratios
do not just explain the future prices that analysts expect. They also explain the
realized prices that we later observe in the data. To provide the cleanest possible
empirical setting, we study how a company’s share price changes following an
earnings surprise.
To see the logic behind our test, imagine that a company just announced
quarterly earnings that were +$0.10per share higher than analysts’ expectations.
It does not take a genius to predict that the firm’s price will likely go up. But
why? What are the possible mechanisms?
To start with, suppose we lived in a world were analysts used a Gordon
model to price each company’s expected future earnings stream
Price𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]×
1
𝑟−𝑔
(20)
This is just Equation (4)but with EPS in place of dividends. In this scenario,
there are two ways that a +$0.10per share earnings surprise could cause a
company’s price to increase. Short-term earnings expectations could rise—i.e.,
higher E𝑡[EPS𝑡+1]. There could also be multiples expansion—i.e., larger 1
𝑟−𝑔
.
Moreover , investors should be more likely to change their multiple following a
large earnings surprise, which often signal important long-term changes.
By contrast, our model says that the price change should be proportional to
the firm’s trailing P/E ratio at the time of its +$0.10per share earnings surprise
ΔPrice𝑡+1={𝜆·$0.10}×TrailingPE𝑡 for some𝜆 >0 (21)
Good news cannot change the past. The company’s trialing P/E is set in stone. A
positive+$0.10per share earnings surprise this quarter will only cause analysts
to increase their EPS forecast for the year by +$0.10. This will push their price
target up by ΔPriceTarget𝑡=$0.10×TrailingPE𝑡, and the company’s share price
will grow in response to the resulting increase in investor demand.
51
We cannot predict the value of 𝜆based on first principles. But we can
estimate this parameter using the available data. The same 𝜆should apply
regardless of whether the firm announces earnings that are +$0.10higher than
expected (like we have considered so far) or +$0.30higher than expected. It
also should not matter if the firm falls short of analysts’ expectations by −$0.20
per share. It should be the same constant of proportionality in all cases.
First, we group stock-quarter observations by the size of their earnings
surprise,𝑠∈{− $0.30,..., $0.30}, which we define relative to the consensus
forecast. Then, within each bucket, we run a separate regression to estimate the
relationship between a stock’s trailing P/E ratio and its subsequent price change
ΔPrice𝑛,𝑞+1∼ˆ𝜅𝑠+ˆ𝜆𝑠·TrailingPE𝑛,𝑞using data on firm-qtr
obs where(𝑛,𝑞)∈𝑁𝑠(22)
where𝑁𝑠={(𝑛,𝑞):eps𝑛,𝑞−E𝑡Ancmt−1[eps𝑛,𝑞]=𝑠}is the set of stock-quarter
observations where the firm announced had a 𝑠dollar per share earnings
surprise. This gives us 60distinct estimates for 𝜆·𝑠. Finally, we check whether
these estimated values all share a key property, ˆ𝜆𝑠/𝑠=𝜆.
Notice how this approach mirrors the standard logic behind textbook asset-
pricing econometrics. For example, think about the Fama and MacBeth (1973)
approach to testing the CAPM. First, you group stocks into portfolios. Then,
you estimate each portfolio’s market beta, 𝛽, by running a separate time-series
regression. Finally, you check whether there is a linear relationship between
each portfolio’s excess returns and its estimated 𝛽.
Average excess returns and market betas do not line up neatly on the security
market line as predicted by the CAPM. But Figure 20 shows that our estimated
slope coefficients,{ˆ𝜆𝑠}, do increase linearly in the size of the underlying earnings
surprise,𝑠. The black dots show the coefficients associated with 60different
levels of earnings surprise: 𝑠∈{− $0.30,...,−$0.01,$0.01,..., $0.30}per share.
We omit the 𝑠=$0.00bin where there is no surprise.
When a firm announces quarterly earnings that way above or below analysts’
consensus expectation, it is often a sign that something important has changed
about the firm’s situation. Large surprises often signal a persistent change in the

company’s future earnings. Hence, in a world where investors were following
textbook logic, we would expect to see them use larger multiples following very
positive earnings surprises and smaller multiples after very negative surprises.
Hence, in a textbook world, we would not find a neat linear relationship like
the one we see in Figure 20. Instead, we should see an “S”-shaped pattern or even
something that looks like a sine wave. If stock 𝐴hasTrailingPE𝐴=20×while
stock𝐵hasTrailingPE𝐴=10×, then maybe stock 𝐴might have double the price
reaction for small earnings surprises. But, for large surprises, forward-looking
investors would revise their choice of multiple to reflect persistent changes,
meaning that the difference between stock 𝐴and stock𝐵should attenuate in
the tails. We do not see that happen.
Our 0.19second-stage slope coefficient implies that, following an 𝑠=$0.10
per share earnings surprise, the share price of stock 𝐴with TrailingPE𝐴=20×
will increase by $0.19=0.19·{$0.10×20−$0.10×10}more than the share
price of stock 𝐵with TrailingPE𝐵=10×. If both firms had realized an 𝑠=$0.20
per share earnings surprise, then stock 𝐴’s share price would have gone up by
$0.38more than stock 𝐵’s over the subsequent quarter . An 𝑠=$0.30per share

earnings surprise would lead to a $0.57difference between the two stocks’
price growth. It is exactly as predicted by the exclusion restriction we outline
in Proposition 2.4. The trailing P/E is set in stone. A piece of news changes a
company’s price by altering investors’ short-term earnings expectations.
We know from cross-sectional asset pricing that a researcher’s choice of
test portfolios can effect how well a model appears to fit the data (Lewellen,
Nagel, and Shanken, 2010). So, in Table 12, we show the results of analogous
second-stage regressions where we group firm-quarter observations into bins
that are $0.02wide and $0.05wide. We get quantitatively similar results no
matter how finely we divide our portfolios. The intercept is always a precisely
estimated zero. This straight line exists because investors are using a trailing
P/E ratio to update a firm’s price following earnings surprises.
54
Conclusion
Investors sometimes set price equal to expected discounted payoff. For
example, bond markets are largely governed by present-value logic. Investors
also rely on DCF models in certain niche industries. This is how marine shipping
MLPs, mining operations, and REITs typically get valued. However , asset-pricing
researchers currently take it for granted that investors always enforce present-
value relationships. This is simply not true. Every model should not start with
price equals expected discounted payoff.
We show that sell-side analysts typically do not discount any expected future
payoffs when valuing large publicly traded companies. Instead, they capitalize
their short-term EPS expectations into a price target with a trailing P/E ratio.
The analysts in textbook models ask themselves: “What is the present value of
a company’s expected future earnings stream in today’s dollars?” Real-world
analysts ask a different question: “How would a comparable firm have been
price last year if it had announced similar earnings?”
Market participants do not usually share their subjective payoff expectations
with us. Sell-side analysts are the exception. As a result, their earnings forecasts
have had a massive impact on the asset-pricing literature. Researchers have
spent decades plugging these numbers into various present-value relationships
in an effort to understand analysts’ discount rate. However , analysts tell us how
they price their own subjective earnings expectations in the text of their report.
More often than not, it has nothing to do with discount rates. As a rule, they
generally use a trailing P/E.
“Price equals expected discounted payoff” is clearly not a sensible assump-
tion to make when modeling sell-side analysts. The next time you write down
an asset-pricing model, we want you to consider whether this “one simple
concept” is a sensible assumption in your application. It might not. To show how
productive alternative approaches can be, we build an equilibrium asset-pricing
model based on PriceTarget =E[EPS]×TrailingPE . We take this model to the
data and find that it explains both analysts’ price targets and how market prices
respond to earnings announcements.

A Technical Appendix
Proof. (Proposition 2.2) This result follows from manipulating Equation (10)
PriceTarget𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×TrailingPE𝑡 (A.1a)
PriceTarget𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×
Price𝑡
EPS𝑡
(A.1b)
PriceTarget𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]
EPS𝑡
×Price𝑡 (A.1c)
PriceTarget𝑡
Price𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]
EPS𝑡(A.1d)
PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡
Price𝑡=E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡(A.1e)
Thus, if demand growth over the next year is proportional to PriceTarget𝑡−Price𝑡
Price𝑡
,
then it must also be proportional to E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
. □
Proof. (Proposition 2.3) Suppose that year-over-year price growth is governed
by the law of motion in Equation (13). Then, if we take expectations under the
objectively correct distribution, we will get
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡
Price𝑡=𝜈×
Demand 𝑡+1−Demand 𝑡
Demand 𝑡
(A.2)
59
Note that investors choose their demand for the upcoming year (𝑡+1)at time𝑡,
so Demand 𝑡+1is not a random variable.
We use the fact that investors proportionally adjust their portfolio holdings in
response to changes in analysts’ near-term earnings forecasts to rewrite things as
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡
Price𝑡=(𝜈·𝜇)×E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
(A.3)
We now have an equation linking analysts’ subjective EPS forecast to the firm’s
average price under the physical density that researchers can observe in the data.
From here, we simply need to rearrange terms to express the firm’s average
price next year as analysts’ near-term earnings forecast times a trailing P/E ratio
plus some additional terms
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡
Price𝑡=(𝜈·𝜇)×E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
(A.4a)
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]
Price𝑡=(𝜈·𝜇)×E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]
EPS𝑡
+(1−𝜈·𝜇) (A.4b)
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]=(𝜈·𝜇)×E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]×
Price𝑡
EPS𝑡
+(1−𝜈·𝜇)×Price𝑡(A.4c)
By inspection, it is clear that the unwanted terms disappear if 𝜇=1/𝜈.□
Proof. (Proposition 2.4) Equation (A.4a) from the proof to Proposition 2.3 above
states that
ˆE𝑡[Price𝑡+1]−Price𝑡
Price𝑡=(𝜈·𝜇)×E𝑡[EPS𝑡+2]−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
(A.4a)
The left-hand side of this equation is ˆE𝑡[Return𝑡+1]. The right-hand side is a
function of the analysts’ expectations about short-term earnings as defined in
Equation (9), which we have reproduced below

EPS𝑡+1−EPS𝑡
EPS𝑡
=𝑋𝑡+𝜖𝑡+1 (9)
𝑋𝑡≈E𝑡[ΔlogEPS𝑡+1]is the expected rate at which the company’s earnings will
grow over the next year , and 𝜖𝑡+1IID∼Normal(0,𝜎2)is a noise term. Hence, a signal
that is uncorrelated with 𝑋𝑡cannot explain differences in ˆE𝑡[Return𝑡+1].□
